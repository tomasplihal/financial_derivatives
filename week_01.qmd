## What Are Derivatives?

### Understanding Derivatives

- A derivative is a financial contract whose value depends on the performance of **an
underlying asset**.
- This underlying asset, referred to as the underlying, may be a stock, currency,
interest rate, commodity, or any other marketable item. Its market price is known as the
cash or spot price.
- The range of underlying assets encompasses a wide array, including stocks, currencies,
commodities, debt instruments, and even non-traditional metrics like weather conditions
or insurance claims.

### The Significance of Derivatives

Derivatives are pivotal in the financial ecosystem due to their ability to:

- Facilitate risk management by transferring risks between parties.
- Craft unique investment strategies and returns not feasible with direct investments.
- Serve as a source of market insight and future price expectations.
- Offer cost efficiencies in transactions.
- Minimize required capital investment.
- Simplify the process of taking short positions compared to dealing with the underlying
directly.
- Enhance the liquidity and operational efficiency of the primary markets they relate
to.

## Derivative Markets

Derivatives are traded in two main venues: **organized exchanges** and
**over-the-counter (OTC)** markets.

### Exchange-Traded Derivatives

These derivatives are **standardized** contracts with fixed features such as contract
size, expiration date, and underlying assets. Their trading is **guaranteed by a
clearing house**, which requires participants to post margins. This arrangement ensures
transparency and regulation, safeguarding the integrity of the market.

### Over-The-Counter (OTC) Derivatives

In contrast, OTC derivatives offer **customization** in terms of contract size, asset
specification, and expiration dates. This flexibility, however, comes with a higher risk
of default (credit risk) for the parties involved. 

#### The OTC Market Evolution

- **Prior to 2008**: The OTC market was largely unregulated, with banks serving as the
primary market makers. Transactions were governed by master agreements, and some were
cleared through central counterparties (CCPs), similar to clearing houses.

- **Since 2008**: Significant regulatory changes have been implemented to reduce
systemic risk and enhance transparency. Standardized OTC transactions must now be
cleared through CCPs, and all trades are required to be reported to a central
repository. These measures aim to bolster market stability and integrity.

# The Lehman Bankruptcy

The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, stands as the largest in U.S.
history. Lehman Brothers was heavily involved in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
market, engaging in high-risk financial activities. The firm's inability to refinance
its short-term debt ultimately led to its downfall. At the time of its bankruptcy,
Lehman Brothers had an extensive network of transactions, with hundreds of thousands
outstanding across approximately 8,000 counterparties. The process of unwinding these
transactions has posed significant challenges for both the Lehman liquidators and the
involved counterparties, illustrating the complex and interconnected nature of modern
financial markets.

## Forward Contracts vs. Contingent Claims

Both forward contracts and contingent claims are essential financial instruments that
derive their value from the performance of an underlying asset, playing pivotal roles in
the global financial markets for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage.

### Forward Commitments

Forward commitments are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future
date and price. They include:

- **Forward Contracts**: Private, ***non-standardized*** agreements between two parties
to buy or sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed upon at the
contract's initiation.
  
- **Futures Contracts**: ***Standardized*** forward contracts traded on organized
exchanges that require the posting of a margin. Futures contracts are marked to market
daily, which mitigates credit risk.
  
- **Swaps**: Agreements between two parties to exchange sequences of cash flows for a
set period based on a specified principal amount. Swaps often involve the exchange of a
fixed interest rate for a floating rate, or vice versa.

### Contingent Claims

Contingent claims are financial instruments that ***offer the holder the right, but not
the obligation***, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price within a specified
timeframe. The primary form of contingent claims is:

- **Options**: Contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy
(call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a specified strike price on or
before a certain date. Options are of two types: *European options*, which can be
exercised only at expiration, and *American options*, which can be exercised at any time
before expiration.

### Key Differences and Risks

- **Obligation vs. Right**: A forward contract represents an obligation to carry out the
transaction, potentially leading to large losses depending on the market's movement. In
contrast, a contingent claim like an option provides a right, limiting the buyer's
potential loss to the premium paid for acquiring this right.

- **Risk Profile**: The potential loss on a long forward contract can equal the full
contract price, while for a short position, the loss can be theoretically infinite due
to the asset's price potential to rise indefinitely. Conversely, the risk of a
contingent claim is limited to the premium paid, providing a risk-averse strategy for
speculators and hedgers.

- **Uses and Applications**: Forward contracts and futures are commonly used for hedging
against price movements in commodities, currencies, and interest rates. Swaps are
utilized for managing interest rate risk and currency exposure. Options are employed for
hedging, speculative trading, and income generation through premium collection.

Incorporating these instruments into investment and risk management strategies requires
an understanding of their mechanics, risks, and market behavior. Their usage reflects
the financial goals, risk tolerance, and market outlook of the participants,
illustrating the complexity and diversity of modern financial markets.

## Types of Derivatives

### Forward Contract

::: {.callout-tip}
A **forward contract** is a customized, over-the-counter derivative agreement between
two parties, where the buyer agrees to purchase, and the seller agrees to sell, an
underlying asset at a predetermined future date and price established at the contract's
inception.
:::

- **Long Position**: The party committing to purchase the asset.
- **Short Position**: The party committing to sell the asset.

#### Characteristics of Forward Contracts {.unnumbered}

- **Underlying Asset**: Specifies the type and quantity of the asset to be traded.
- **Settlement Method**: Describes how the contract will be executed or settled upon
expiration.
- **Forward Price**: The agreed-upon price for the underlying asset exchange, designed
to make the contract's initial value zero.

#### Key Points {.unnumbered}

- **Popularity in Foreign Exchange**: Forward contracts are frequently used for hedging
in the foreign exchange markets.
- **OTC Markets**: Typically involves at least one financial institution, allowing for
customization but lacking centralized regulation.
- **Flexibility and Risk Management**: Forward contracts offer tailored solutions for
specific hedging needs, particularly in markets lacking standardized instruments. This
customization enables precise risk management tailored to the parties' unique
requirements.
- **Market Dynamics and Pricing**: The determination of forward prices is influenced by
various factors, including the underlying asset's current price, interest rates, and the
asset's expected future price volatility. This dynamic pricing mechanism reflects the
market's consensus on future price movements, adjusted for the time value of money.

### Futures Contract

- A futures contract is a **standardized** derivative traded on **futures exchanges**,
like the [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com/) or [Intercontinental
Exchange](https://www.theice.com/about/exchanges-clearing), facilitating the buying and
selling of underlying assets at future dates.

- **Futures and Liquidity**: Futures contracts provide liquidity and price discovery in
a regulated environment, offering a transparent and efficient means for market
participants to hedge against price volatility or speculate on future price movements.

#### Forwards vs. Futures {.unnumbered}

| Forwards                                           | Futures                                             |
| :--------------------------------------------------| :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Customized terms, traded over-the-counter.         | Standardized terms, traded on regulated exchanges.  |
| Counterparty risk, with less regulatory oversight. | Mitigated counterparty risk through clearinghouses. |
| Settlement occurs at contract maturity.            | Daily mark-to-market settlement.                    |

### Swap Contract 

- A **swap** is an OTC derivative where two parties exchange cash flow series,
addressing multi-period risks. Unlike a forward contract focusing on a single-period
risk, swaps often manage interest rate, currency, or commodity exposure over extended
periods.

- Swaps can be structured in numerous ways to suit different types of risk management
strategies. For example, interest rate swaps exchange fixed for floating interest rate
payments to manage interest rate risk, while currency swaps exchange cash flows in
different currencies to hedge against currency risk.

### Options

::: {.callout-tip}
Options are versatile financial derivatives allowing the holder to buy (call option) or
sell (put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) within a
specific timeframe. The buyer of the option pays a premium to the seller or writer for
this right, without the obligation to execute the transaction.
:::

#### Types of Options {.unnumbered}

- **Call Options**: Grant the holder the right to **purchase** the underlying asset at
the strike price. Investors buy calls when they anticipate the underlying asset's price
will increase.
  
- **Put Options**: Provide the holder the right to **sell** the underlying asset at the
strike price. Puts are purchased when an investor expects the underlying asset's price
to decline.

#### Exercise Styles {.unnumbered}

- **American Options**: These can be exercised at any point up to and including the
expiration date, offering maximum flexibility to the holder.
  
- **European Options**: Can only be exercised on the expiration date itself, limiting
the timing of execution to this single moment.

## Applications of Derivatives

### Hedging

Hedging is a strategic financial practice aimed at reducing potential risks and
mitigating financial exposure. Its core purpose is to **minimize risk**, though it does
not assure a more favorable outcome. This strategy employs various financial
instruments, such as forward and option contracts, each with distinct characteristics
and uses.

Forward contracts are pivotal in risk management, enabling the hedger to lock in a
future transaction price for an underlying asset, thereby neutralizing the risk of
adverse price fluctuations. This fixed-price agreement ensures predictability in
financial planning.

Option contracts, on the other hand, serve as a form of financial insurance. They grant
investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option)
an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) within a specific timeframe.
This mechanism allows investors to safeguard against potential adverse price movements
while preserving the opportunity to capitalize on favorable price changes. Unlike
forward contracts, acquiring an option requires paying an upfront premium, which
represents the cost of the protection offered.

#### Examples to Illustrate Hedging {.unnumbered}

1. Consider a U.S. company that anticipates a payment of GBP 10 million for imports from
Britain in three months. To hedge against the risk of GBP appreciating against USD, the
company can enter into a long position in a forward contract. By doing so, it secures a
fixed exchange rate for the future payment, thus avoiding the uncertainty of currency
fluctuations.

2. An investor holding 1,000 shares of Microsoft, valued at \$28 per share, faces the
risk of a potential decrease in share value. To mitigate this risk, the investor can
purchase a put option, which provides the right to sell the shares at a strike price of
\$27.50. For example, if a two-month put option costs \$1 per share, the investor would
buy 10 contracts (each contract typically covers 100 shares), paying a total premium of
\$1,000. This strategy protects the investor's portfolio from a decline below the strike
price, while still allowing participation in any upward price movements.

### Arbitrage

Arbitrage represents a foundational concept in financial markets, involving the
exploitation of price differentials across different markets or forms of an asset to
secure risk-free profits. This practice underscores the **Law of One Price**, which
posits that in efficient markets with minimal transaction costs and unrestricted
information flow, identical assets should uniformly price.

When disparities arise, arbitrageurs can purchase the undervalued asset in one market
and sell it at a higher price in another, leveraging these discrepancies to generate a
risk-free return. This activity not only capitalizes on the price differentials but also
plays a crucial role in driving the prices of identical assets towards convergence, thus
contributing to market efficiency.

Arbitrage serves as a relative valuation method, providing insights into the correct
pricing of one asset or derivative in relation to another. It operates under the
principle that no two identical assets should exist with different pricing or that
equivalent asset combinations yielding the same returns should not vary in price.

The presence and subsequent elimination of arbitrage opportunities are indicative of
market efficiency, where markets compensate investors for risks appropriately. However,
when arbitrage allows for returns above the risk-free rate without exposure to risk, it
challenges the notions of market efficiency by presenting an anomaly of abnormal
returns.

#### Example to Illustrate Arbitrage {.unnumbered}

Imagine a scenario where a stock is priced at GBP 100 in London and USD 150 in New York,
with the current exchange rate being 1.5300 USD/GBP. An arbitrage opportunity arises if
the price of the stock, when converted using the current exchange rate, does not match
across these markets. By buying the stock in the market where it is undervalued and
selling it in the market where it is overvalued, an arbitrageur can secure a risk-free
profit, highlighting the practical application of arbitrage in rectifying price
discrepancies and promoting market efficiency.

### Speculation

Speculation in financial markets is driven by the intention to profit from anticipated
market movements. Speculators engage in market positions with the expectation that
prices will either rise or fall, aiming to capitalize on these predicted changes.

When engaging in futures contracts, speculators face significant risk and reward
potential. Futures contracts obligate the purchase or sale of an asset at a
predetermined future date and price, exposing the speculator to potentially unlimited
losses or gains, depending on market movements.

Conversely, options contracts offer a different risk profile. By purchasing options, a
speculator gains the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put
option) an asset at a specified price within a certain period. The maximum loss in this
scenario is limited to the premium paid for the options, providing a safety net against
adverse market movements.

#### Examples to Illustrate Speculation {.unnumbered}

Trading strategies for an investor with \$2,000 anticipating a stock price increase:

1. **Buying Shares Outright:** If the investor is confident in their prediction and
prefers direct exposure, they could use their \$2,000 to buy shares of the stock
directly. This approach offers unlimited upside potential if the stock price increases
but also exposes the investor to potential losses if the price falls.

2. **Buying Call Options:** The investor could purchase call options on the stock they
believe will increase in value. This strategy allows the investor to control a larger
amount of stock with a smaller investment (the premium paid for the options), with the
potential for significant gains if the stock price rises as anticipated. The risk is
limited to the premium paid.

3. **Futures Contracts:** If the investor has access to futures trading and is
knowledgeable about its risks, they could engage in a futures contract that bets on the
stock price increasing. This strategy requires careful risk management due to the
potential for large losses.

## Criticisms and Misuses of Derivatives

Derivatives, while fundamental to risk management and price discovery in financial
markets, have faced criticisms and concerns regarding their potential for misuse and the
risks they can introduce to the financial system. These criticisms encompass several key
areas:

1. **Speculation and Gambling:** Derivatives are often utilized for speculative
purposes, where investors bet on the direction of market prices with the aim of
generating profits. This speculative use can resemble gambling when trades are made
based on predictions rather than informed decisions, potentially leading to significant
losses.

2. **Systemic Risk and Destabilization:** Derivatives can add systemic risk to the
financial system, especially when used in large volumes or in complex combinations that
are difficult to understand and manage. The interconnectedness of market participants
through derivatives can lead to contagion effects, where the failure of one entity can
trigger a chain reaction affecting others.

3. **Complexity:** The inherent complexity of many derivative products makes them
difficult to value and understand, even for sophisticated investors. This complexity can
obscure the real risks involved and lead to mispricing or inappropriate use of these
instruments.

4. **Role Shifting:** Traders and institutions may shift roles between being hedgers,
who use derivatives to manage risk, to speculators, who seek to profit from market
movements, or from being arbitrageurs, who exploit price discrepancies, to speculators.
This shifting can blur the lines between risk management and speculative activities,
increasing the potential for losses and systemic risks.

5. **Need for Controls:** Given the potential for misuse and the complex nature of
derivatives, it is crucial to establish comprehensive controls and regulatory
frameworks. These controls should ensure that derivatives are used for their intended
purposes, such as hedging risk, rather than for unchecked speculation. Proper oversight,
transparent reporting requirements, and clear guidelines for risk assessment and
management are essential components of a robust regulatory framework.

To address these criticisms and mitigate the risks associated with derivatives,
financial markets and regulatory bodies have implemented measures such as:

- **Central Clearing Counterparties (CCPs):** These entities act as intermediaries for
derivative transactions, reducing counterparty risk and increasing transparency.

- **Margin Requirements:** These requirements ensure that parties in derivative
contracts have sufficient capital to cover potential losses, reducing the risk of
default.

- **Regulatory Reforms:** Post-2008 financial crisis, reforms like the Dodd-Frank Act in
the United States and EMIR in Europe have increased oversight and regulation of
derivative markets, aiming to improve transparency, reduce systemic risk, and ensure
that derivatives fulfill their role in financial markets responsibly.
