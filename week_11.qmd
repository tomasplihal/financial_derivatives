## Case Study

- A bank sells a European call option for \$300,000, covering 100,000 shares of a stock
that does not pay dividends.
- **Initial Stock Price ($S_0$)**: \$49
- **Strike Price ($K$)**: \$50
- **Risk-Free Rate ($r$)**: 5% 
- **Volatility ($\sigma$)**: 20%
- **Time to Expiration ($T$)**: 20 weeks
- **Expected Return ($\mu$)**: 13%
- **Black-Scholes-Merton Valuation**: \$240,000
- **Objective**: Determine how the bank can hedge its risk to secure a \$60,000 profit.

### Naked Position

- **Description**: The bank takes no protective action against the position’s exposure.
- **Risk Analysis**: This strategy leaves the position fully exposed to market
fluctuations, with potential unlimited losses if the stock price rises significantly.

### Covered Position

- **Description**: The bank purchases 100,000 shares immediately.
- **Risk Analysis**: Although this strategy can mitigate the risk if the stock’s price
increases above the strike price, it requires significant capital investment and is
exposed to loss if the stock price declines.

### Dynamic Hedging: Stop-Loss Strategy

- **Buy**: 100,000 shares are purchased when the stock price hits \$50.

- **Sell**: 100,000 shares are sold when the stock price drops below \$50.

- **Risk**: This approach attempts to limit losses by dynamically adjusting the position
based on stock price movements. However, it may lead to high transaction costs and
potential slippage; the actual transaction price may not always align with the trigger
price due to market volatility.

The most efficient way to hedge would be to use **Greek letters.**

## The Greek Letters

Greek letters are vital tools in options trading, providing a quantitative understanding
of the sensitivity of an option's price to various factors. These metrics are crucial
for effective risk management and strategic decision-making in trading portfolios.

- The Greeks are typically calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, a
foundational tool in financial mathematics for valuing options.
- The Greek letters are the partial derivatives with respect to the model parameters
that are liable to change.
- In practice, the volatility parameter in the BSM model is set to the implied
volatility of the option, a modification often referred to as the "practitioner
Black-Scholes" model.
- The discussion here pertains primarily to European options on non-dividend-paying
stocks.

### Description of Key Greeks

The Greeks measure the sensitivity of the option's price to one of the underlying
parameters, **holding all other parameters constant**. Each Greek addresses a different
risk factor:

- **Delta ($\Delta$)**: Measures the rate of **change of the option's price** with
respect to changes in the underlying asset's price. Specifically, delta is the first
derivative of the option's price with respect to the stock's price. For instance, a
delta of 0.6 suggests the option’s price will move approximately \$0.60 for every \$1.00
movement in the underlying stock.

- **Gamma ($\Gamma$)**: Represents the rate of **change of delta** with respect to
changes in the underlying asset's price. Gamma helps assess the stability of an option's
delta, providing insight into how delta might change as the stock price varies. High
gamma values indicate that delta is highly sensitive to changes in the stock price.

- **Theta ($\Theta$)**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to **the passage
of time**, known as "time decay." Theta indicates the expected rate of change in the
option's price for a one-day decrease in its time to expiration. This is particularly
important as the option approaches its expiry date.

- **Vega ($\nu$)**: Quantifies the sensitivity of the option’s price to **changes in the
volatility** of the underlying asset. A vega of 1.5 suggests that the option's price is
expected to change by \$1.50 for every 1% change in the implied volatility of the
underlying stock.

- **Rho ($\rho$)**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to **changes in the
risk-free interest rate**. For instance, a rho of 0.05 indicates that the option’s price
will change by \$0.05 for every 1% change in interest rates.

## Understanding Delta ($\Delta$)

Delta is a measure of an option's price sensitivity relative to changes in the price of
the underlying asset. It's expressed as the amount an option's price is expected to move
for a one-unit change in the price of the underlying asset.

![](images/11-2-calculation-delta.png)

The followint graph showing how delta varies with stock price for call and put options.

![Variation of Delta With Stock Price (K=50)](images/11-3-delta-vs-stock.png)

- **Call Option (a)**: Delta increases as the stock price rises, peaking near 1 as the
option goes deep in-the-money.

- **Put Option (b)**: Delta decreases (becomes more negative) as the stock price drops,
indicating increased sensitivity as the option moves further in-the-money.

The next graph showing how delta changes as time to maturity decreases.

![Variation of Delta with Time to Maturity](images/11-4-delta-time.png)

Delta's sensitivity to time decay depends on the moneyness of the option. For options
that are exactly at-the-money, delta converges to 0.5. For out-of-the-money options, it
approaches zero because such options are likely to expire worthless, whereas for
in-the-money options, delta converges to 1.

### Delta Hedging: Principles and Practices

Delta hedging is a strategy used to mitigate risk in option trading by setting up a
position in the underlying asset. The position's size is determined by the option's
delta, aiming to neutralize the effect of small price movements of the underlying asset.

To achieve delta neutrality, the required number of units to hedge, $N_H$, is calculated
using the formula:
$$N_H = -\left(\frac{\text{Portfolio delta}}{\text{Delta of the hedging instrument}} \right)$$

A delta-neutral portfolio implies a total delta of zero, indicating no sensitivity to
small price movements in the underlying stock. Note that the **delta of the stock itself
is always 1**.

- **Rebalancing**: Delta values change as the stock price fluctuates and as time passes,
necessitating periodic rebalancing of the hedge (buy high, sell low).

- **Delta for Calls and Puts**: The delta of a European call option on a non-dividend
paying stock is represented by $N(d_1)$, whereas for a put, it's $N(d_1) - 1$.

:::{.callout-note}
# Example: Delta Hedging I

Consider an investor who holds a short position in 1,000 call options, each with a delta
of -0.6. Create a delta-neutral portfolio to shield against small price movements.

- **Current Delta**: $1,000 \times -0.6 = -600$

- **Hedging Action**: Purchase 600 shares of the stock (since each stock has a delta of
1).

This strategy ensures that any gain or loss on the options is countered by a
corresponding loss or gain in the stock holdings.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
# Example: Delta Hedging II

Consider a portfolio comprising 1,000 shares of a non-dividend-paying stock. Each share
contributes a delta of 1 to the portfolio, resulting in a total portfolio delta of
1,000.

To achieve delta neutrality using call options with a delta of 0.40, we calculate the
required number of calls to sell:

$$N_H = -\left(\frac{1,000}{0.40}\right) = -2,500$$

This means selling 2,500 call options ensures that the positive delta from the stock
holdings is exactly offset by the negative delta contribution from the short call
positions.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
# Example: Delta Hedging III

Consider a scenario where you have a short position in 10,000 shares of a
non-dividend-paying stock:

#### Using Call Options for Hedging:

- **Option Delta ($\Delta_c$)**: 0.668
- To neutralize the negative delta of -10,000 from the short stock position, you would
need to purchase call options to increase delta:

$$N_H = -\left(\frac{-10,000}{0.668}\right) = 14,970$$

Purchasing 14,970 call options will add a positive delta, balancing out the negative
delta from the short stock position.

#### Using Put Options for Hedging:

- **Option Delta ($\Delta_p$)**: -0.332
- To balance the negative delta, you can use put options which inherently have a
negative delta:

$$N_H = -\left(\frac{-10,000}{-0.332}\right) = -30,120$$

Selling 30,120 put options would counteract the negative delta from the short stock
position, achieving neutrality.

### Hedging Cost Scenarios from Case Study

The following table presents a simulation of hedging dynamics when the option expires in-the-money, with total hedging costs amounting to $263,300:

![](images/11-5-delta-simulation.png)

- The cost reflects the higher intrinsic value and sensitivity (delta) as the option gains worth.

- If the option expires out-of-the-money, the costs should be slightly lower, as reduced delta correlates with a decreased likelihood of the option finishing in-the-money.

## Understanding Gamma ($\Gamma$)

Gamma ($\Gamma$) is the second derivative of the option's price with respect to the
underlying asset's price. It measures the rate of change of delta ($\Delta$) and is
crucial for understanding the curvature or the convexity of the option's value in
relation to the stock price. It's crucial for assessing the stability of an option's
delta, thus influencing how often a delta-hedged portfolio needs rebalancing.  Here are
some key characteristics of gamma:

- **Zero for Stocks**: Gamma for a long or short position in a single share of stock is
zero because a stock's delta does not change.
- **Symmetry for Calls and Puts**: Gamma is identical for both call and put options.
- **Non-negativity**: Gamma is always non-negative. It reaches its highest value when an
option is at-the-money, highlighting increased sensitivity at this point.
- **Risk Measurement**: Gamma quantifies the non-linearity risk—risk that remains in a
delta-neutral portfolio due to price movements of the underlying asset.

![](images/11-9-gamma-interpretation.png)

### Gamma and Hedging Dynamics

Gamma plays a critical role in addressing potential errors in delta hedging,
particularly when stock prices exhibit significant movement:

- **Small Changes**: For minor fluctuations in stock price, delta hedging generally
performs well.
- **Larger Shifts**: For more substantial stock price movements, delta-plus-gamma
hedging provides greater accuracy, accommodating the curvature in the relationship
between an option's price and the stock price.
- **Gamma Risk**: This term refers to the risk arising from sudden, significant
movements in stock prices—often referred to as jumps—which can leave a previously
well-hedged position exposed. Gamma risk is particularly relevant in markets
characterized by high volatility or discontinuous price movements.
- **Theta and Gamma Interaction**: Typically, when theta is large and negative,
indicating substantial time decay benefits, gamma tends to be large and positive. This
inverse relationship highlights the trade-offs between potential profitability from time
decay and the risk from larger price movements.

![Gamma variation with stock price](images/11-10-gamma-stock.png)

This chart demonstrates how gamma peaks when an option is at-the-money and diminishes as
the option moves deeper into or out of the money. This pattern underscores the
heightened sensitivity and potential risk/reward near the at-the-money point.

![Gamma variation over time](images/11-11-gamma-time.png)

Gamma increases as the option approaches expiration, particularly for at-the-money
options. This increase reflects growing sensitivity to stock price movements as time to
exercise decreases, emphasizing the importance of precise hedging strategies in the
final days before an option's expiration.

## Understanding Theta ($\Theta$)

Theta ($\Theta$) represents the sensitivity of the price of an option or a portfolio of
derivatives to the passage of time, assuming all other factors remain constant. It is a
critical component in options pricing, reflecting the temporal decay of an option's
value.

- **Directionality**: Theta is typically negative for both calls and puts. This reflects
the loss in time value as options approach their expiration date.
- **Non-applicability to Stocks**: Since stocks do not have an expiration date, they
inherently have a theta of zero.
- **Impact on Options**: Each day closer to expiration decreases the option's time
value, reducing its price if other conditions remain unchanged.

![Theta variation with stock price](images/11-7-theta-stock.png)

The graph illustrates how theta behaves relative to the stock price for a call option.
Notably, theta becomes increasingly negative as the option moves around at-the-money.

![Theta variation over time](images/11-8-theta-time.png)

This visualization shows theta's behavior as the option nears its expiry. Theta
typically becomes more negative as expiration approaches, indicating an acceleration in
the rate of time value decay. This is most pronounced for at-the-money options, where
the uncertainty about finishing in-the-money is highest.

- **Theta vs. Hedge Parameters**: Unlike delta, which can be hedged, theta represents a
guaranteed decline in value over time and is not a hedgeable risk. However, its
predictability and inevitability make it a significant factor in options strategy.
- **Descriptive Utility**: Despite its non-hedgeable nature, theta is considered a
useful descriptive statistic for portfolios, particularly in strategies aimed at earning
through time decay, such as selling options.
- In a delta-neutral setting, where the portfolio is insulated against small price
movements in the underlying asset, theta can serve as an indirect measure of gamma
exposure. This relationship arises because high gamma values, which indicate greater
sensitivity to price changes, usually accompany high rates of time decay (theta). Thus,
monitoring theta provides insights into potential gamma risks in the portfolio.

## Understanding Vega ($\nu$)

Vega represents the rate of change in the value of an option or a derivatives portfolio
with respect to changes in volatility. This Greek is crucial in options trading,
reflecting how the price of options reacts to fluctuations in the underlying asset's
volatility.

Vega highlights the impact of volatility, an essential but unobservable market factor
that significantly influences option pricing. Future volatility, being an estimation,
adds a layer of complexity and risk in predicting option values.

- **Directionality**: Vega is always positive. An increase in the implied volatility of
the underlying asset generally leads to an increase in the value of both call and put
options.
- **Symmetry**: The vega of a call option is equal to the vega of a put option with the
same terms.
- **Calculation**: For a portfolio, vega can be understood as a weighted average of the
vegas of the individual positions, reflecting the aggregate sensitivity to a uniform
shift in implied volatilities across the portfolio.
- **Volatility Sensitivity**: Of all the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model variables
(stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, and volatility), an
option's price is most sensitive to changes in volatility. This sensitivity makes vega a
key focus in risk management and trading strategies.

![Vega variation with stock price](images/11-12-vega-stock.png)

The chart illustrates how vega changes in relation to the stock price. Vega tends to be
higher when an option is at-the-money and decreases as the option moves deeper into or
out of the money. This pattern reflects the increased sensitivity to volatility changes
when the option's strike price is near the current stock price, where the uncertainty
about the outcome at expiration is greatest.

## Understanding Rho ($\rho$)

Rho represents the sensitivity of an option or a derivatives portfolio's value to
changes in the risk-free interest rate. It is one of the lesser-focused Greeks but plays
a crucial role in environments where interest rate fluctuations are significant.

- **Directionality**: Rho is typically positive for call options and negative for put
options. This reflects the different financial implications of options:
  - **Call Options**: A positive Rho for call options indicates that their value
  increases as interest rates rise. This is because higher rates reduce the present
  value of the exercise price paid at expiration, making it cheaper in present terms to
  buy the stock at a future date.
  - **Put Options**: Conversely, a negative Rho for put options means their value
  decreases as interest rates rise. Higher rates increase the present value of the
  proceeds received from selling the stock in the future, thus decreasing the
  attractiveness of holding a put.

The sensitivity to interest rates through Rho might seem minor compared to other Greeks
like Delta or Vega, but it can become significant in certain financial environments:

- **High Interest Rate Volatility**: In periods of significant interest rate changes,
Rho becomes a more critical factor for traders, especially those dealing with long-dated
options where the cumulative impact of rate changes can be substantial.
- **Portfolio Management**: For portfolios that include a mix of long-dated options and
bonds, understanding and managing Rho is vital to hedge interest rate risks effectively.

## Strategic Management of Delta, Gamma, and Vega

Proper management of the Greek values—Delta, Gamma, and Vega—is essential for
maintaining balanced options portfolios that align with specific risk management
objectives. Here, we outline techniques to achieve neutrality in these Greeks through
strategic positioning in options and the underlying asset.

- **Delta**: This Greek can be adjusted directly by taking positions in the underlying
asset. For instance, buying or selling stock can increase or decrease the portfolio's
delta.

- **Gamma and Vega**: Adjustments to gamma and vega generally require engaging in
positions in options or other derivatives, as these Greeks measure sensitivity to
changes in the underlying asset's price and volatility, respectively.

The general approach involves **first hedging vega and/or gamma** using options, and
then as a **final step, using underlying assets** to reduce delta to zero. This sequence
is important because hedging vega and gamma can alter delta, whereas hedging using
underlying assets does not affect vega or gamma.

# Example: Achieving Greek Neutrality

|           | Delta | Gamma | Vega  |
| :-------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Portfolio |   0   | -5000 | -8000 |
| Option 1  |  0.6  |  0.5  |  2.0  |
| Option 2  |  0.5  |  0.8  |  1.2  |

1. **Achieving Delta and Gamma Neutrality**:
   - **Required Position**: Long 10,000 units of Option 1 and short 6,000 units of the
   underlying asset.
   - **Rationale**: This positioning uses the delta and gamma from Option 1 to offset
   the existing negative gamma in the portfolio while also balancing delta.

2. **Achieving Delta and Vega Neutrality**:
   - **Required Position**: Long 4,000 units of Option 1 and short 2,400 units of the
   underlying asset.
   - **Rationale**: This configuration uses Option 1's vega to counteract the
   portfolio's negative vega while adjusting the delta with a corresponding position in
   the underlying asset.

3. **Achieving Delta, Gamma, and Vega Neutrality Across Multiple Options**:
   - **System of Equations**:
     - For Gamma: $$-5000 + 0.5 w_1 + 0.8 w_2 = 0$$
     - For Vega: $$-8000 + 2.0 w_1 + 1.2 w_2 = 0$$
   - **Solution**: Long 400 units of Option 1 and 6,000 units of Option 2, with a short
   position of 3,240 units in the underlying asset to achieve complete neutrality in
   delta, gamma, and vega.

### Hedging in Practice

- **Daily Delta Neutrality**: Traders typically adjust their portfolios to be
delta-neutral at least once per day to manage risk effectively against price movements
in the underlying asset.

- **Opportunistic Gamma and Vega Adjustments**: While daily adjustments for delta are
common, adjustments for gamma and vega are made as opportunities arise, allowing traders
to better manage the curvature and volatility risks associated with their positions.

- **Economies of Scale**: As portfolios increase in size, the relative cost of hedging
per option decreases, providing cost efficiencies in larger portfolios.

- **Scenario Analysis**: This involves testing different market scenarios and their
effects on the portfolio, considering various assumptions about asset prices and
volatilities. This analysis helps in understanding potential impacts and preparing for
various market conditions.

## Practice Questions and Problems

1. Explain how a stop-loss trading rule can be implemented for the writer of an
out-of-the money call option. Why does it provide a relatively poor hedge?

2. What does it mean to assert that the delta of a call option is 0.7? How can a short
position in 1,000 options be made delta neutral when the delta of each option is 0.7?

3. What does it mean to assert that the theta of an option position is -0.1 when time is
measured in years? If a trader feels that neither a stock price nor its implied
volatility will change, what type of option position is appropriate?

4. What is meant by the gamma of an option position? What are the risks in the situation
where the gamma of a position is large and negative and the delta is zero?

5. A bank’s position in options on the dollar–euro exchange rate has a delta of 30,000
and a gamma of 80,000. Explain how these numbers can be interpreted. The exchange rate
(dollars per euro) is 0.90. What position would you take to make the position delta
neutral? After a short period of time, the exchange rate moves to 0.93. Estimate the new
delta. What additional trade is necessary to keep the position delta neutral?  Assuming
the bank did set up a delta-neutral position originally, has it gained or lost money
from the exchange-rate movement?

6. A financial institution has the following portfolio of stock options:

    | Type  | Position | Delta | Gamma | Vega  |
    | :---: | :------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
    | Call  |  -1,000  |  0.5  |  2.2  |  1.8  |
    | Call  |   -500   |  0.8  |  0.6  |  0.2  |
    |  Put  |  -2,000  | -0.4  |  1.3  |  0.7  |
    | Call  |   -500   |  0.7  |  1.8  |  1.4  |

    1. What position would make the portfolio delta neutral? 
    2. What position in the traded option and in stocks would make the portfolio both
    gamma neutral and delta neutral? 
    3. What position in the traded option and in stocks would make the portfolio both
    vega neutral and delta neutral?
    4. Suppose that a second traded option with a delta of 0.1, a gamma of 0.5, and a
    vega of 0.6 is available. How could the portfolio be made delta, gamma, and vega
    neutral?
