## Understanding Options

:::{.callout-tip}
# Definition

Options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the **right, but not the
obligation**, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined
price (strike price) on or before a specific date. The seller (writer) receives a
premium in exchange for granting this right.
:::

Types of options: 

- **Call Option**: Gives the holder the right **to buy an asset** at the strike price
before expiration. Buyers expect the asset’s price to rise.
- **Put Option**: Gives the holder the right **to sell an asset** at the strike price
before expiration. Buyers expect the asset’s price to fall.

Execution Styles:

- **American Option**: Can be exercised **at any time before expiration**, offering more
flexibility.
- **European Option**: Can only be exercised **on the expiration date**, making it more
predictable but less flexible.

Options can be written on various assets, including:

- Stocks
- ETFs and ETPs
- Foreign currency
- Stock indices
- Futures

**Margin account:**

- Buying options **does not require margin** as the buyer's risk is limited to the
premium paid.
- Selling options **requires margin** due to the obligation to fulfill the contract.

**Option Value Components:**

- **Intrinsic Value**: The profit from immediate exercise.
- **Time Value**: The extra value reflecting potential future price changes.

## Option Payoffs and Profits

### Understanding Option Payoffs

The option buyer's payoff depends on the relationship between the price of the
underlying asset at expiration ($S_T$) and strike price of the option ($K$).

Moneyness determines whether exercising the option would be profitable:

- **In the Money (ITM)**: Exercising the option yields a positive payoff.
- **At the Money (ATM)**: The option's strike price equals the asset price ($S_T = K$).
There is no intrinsic value.
- **Out of the Money (OTM)**: Exercising the option results in zero payoff.

Moneyness is crucial for pricing and trading decisions, as ITM options have intrinsic
value, while ATM and OTM options are purely speculative.

- **Call Option Payoff**: 
$$
c_T = \max(0, S_T - K)
$$
- **Put Option Payoff**:
$$
p_T = \max(0, K - S_T)
$$

:::{.callout-note}
# Example: Option Payoff

Given an underlying asset price at expiration $S_T$ of \$28 and a strike price $K$ of
\$25, the payoffs for call and put options are calculated as follows:

- **Call Buyer Payoff**: $c_T = \max(0, \$28 - \$25) = \$3$
- **Put Buyer Payoff**: $p_T = \max(0, \$25 - \$28) = \$0$

The call is **in the money** with a payoff of \$3, while the put is **out of the money**
with no payoff.
:::

### Calculating Option Profit

To determine profit, the option premium ($c_0$ for calls, $p_0$ for puts) must be
considered:

- **Call Option Profit**:
$$
\Pi_{call} = \max(0, S_T - K) - c_0
$$
- **Put Option Profit**:
$$
\Pi_{put} = \max(0, K - S_T) - p_0
$$

:::{.callout-note}
# Example: Option Profit

Considering CBX stock options with a strike price $K = \$30$, where the call and put
premiums are \$1 and \$2 respectively, and the stock price at expiration $S_T$ is
\$27.50:

- **Call Option Profit**: $\Pi_{call} = \max(0, \$27.5 - \$30) - \$1 = -\$1$
- **Put Option Profit**: $\Pi_{put} = \max(0, \$30 - \$27.5) - \$2 = \$0.5$

The call buyer loses \$1, while the put buyer profits \$0.5.
:::

## Dividend Adjustments and Related Assets

### Adjustments for Dividends and Stock Splits

- **Cash Dividends**: Typically do not affect options, as they are factored into
pricing.
- **Stock Splits & Stock Dividends**: Adjustments ensure option value remains unchanged.

For an **$n$-for-$m$ stock split**:

- New Strike Price:
$$
K' = \frac{m}{n} \times K
$$

- New Number of Options:
$$
N' = \frac{n}{m} \times N
$$

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
# Example: Option Adjustments

#### 2-for-1 Stock Split  

A call option for 100 shares at \$20 per share:  

- **New Strike Price**: $\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10$  
- **New Number of Options**: $\frac{2}{1} \times 100 = 200$

#### 5% Stock Dividend  

A call option for 100 shares at \$20 per share:  

- **New Strike Price**: $\frac{1}{1.05} \times 20 = 19.05$  
- **New Number of Options**: $\frac{1.05}{1} \times 100 = 105$
:::

### Related Assets

#### Warrants

- Issued by corporations, granting the right to buy shares at a fixed price.
- Exercising warrants leads to new stock issuance.

#### Employee Stock Options

- Compensation-based options, often issued at-the-money.
- Exercising creates new company shares.

#### Convertible Bonds

- Bonds that can be converted into equity at predetermined terms.
- Often callable, allowing issuers to force conversion.

## Understanding the Dynamics of Option Pricing

The value of stock options depends on several key factors, each influencing option
prices under the **ceteris paribus** (all else equal) assumption. The table below
summarizes the impact of these variables on European and American options:

|         Variable                 | European Call | European Put | American Call | American Put |
|:--------------------------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
|    Current Stock Price ($S_0$)   |      $+$      |     $-$      |      $+$      |     $-$      |
|        Strike Price ($K$)        |      $-$      |     $+$      |      $-$      |     $+$      |
|     Time to Expiration ($T$)     |      $?$      |     $?$      |      $+$      |     $+$      |
|         Volatility ($\sigma$)    |      $+$      |     $+$      |      $+$      |     $+$      |
|       Risk-free Rate ($r$)       |      $+$      |     $-$      |      $+$      |     $-$      |
| Amount of Future Dividends ($D$) |      $-$      |     $+$      |      $-$      |     $+$      |

- $c$, $p$: Prices of European call and put options.
- $C$, $P$: Prices of American call and put options.
- $S_0$: Current stock price.
- $S_T$: Stock price at expiration.
- $K$: Strike price.
- $T$: Time to expiration.
- $\sigma$: Stock price volatility.
- $D$: Present value of future dividends.
- $r$: Risk-free interest rate (continuous compounding).

### American vs. European Options

American options, which can be exercised anytime before expiration, are **always worth
at least as much** as their European counterparts:

$$
C \geq c, \quad P \geq p
$$

This is due to the added flexibility of early exercise, making American options
inherently more valuable or, at minimum, equal in price to European options.

## Upper and Lower Bounds for Option Prices

#### Upper Bound - Call Option

The price of a call option, whether American or European, cannot exceed the current
stock price:
$$
c \leq S_0, \quad C \leq S_0
$$

This prevents arbitrage, as no rational investor would pay more for a call than the
stock itself.

#### Upper Bound - Put Option

- **American put options**: Capped at the strike price since the holder can sell at $K$:
$$
P \leq K
$$
- **European put options**: Limited by the present value of $K$, as they can only be
exercised at expiration:
$$
p \leq K e^{-rT}
$$

#### Lower Bound - European Call Option

The minimum price of a European call on a non-dividend paying stock is:
$$
c \geq \max(S_0 - K e^{-rT}, 0)
$$

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Example: European Call Lower Bound

Given: $S_0 = 20$, $K = 18$, $T = 1$, $r = 10\%$, $D = 0$
$$
\text{Lower bound} = 20 - 18 e^{-0.1} = 3.71
$$

If the call price is \$3, an arbitrageur could **short the stock, buy the call, and
invest at 10%**.
:::

#### Lower Bound - European Put Option

For puts on non-dividend paying stock, the lower bound is:
$$
p \geq \max(K e^{-rT} - S_0, 0)
$$

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Example: European Put Lower Bound

Given: $S_0 = 37$, $K = 40$, $T = 0.5$, $r = 5\%$, $D = 0$
$$
40 e^{-0.05 \times 0.5} - 37 = 2.01
$$

If the put price is \$1, an arbitrageur could **borrow \$38 for six months to buy both
the put and stock**.
:::

### American Options and Early Exercise

#### American Call Options (Non-Dividend Paying Stocks)

**It is never optimal to exercise early** because:

- **Preserving capital**: Delaying exercise defers payment of $K$.
- **Insurance benefit**: Holding the call provides downside protection.
- **Maximizing value**: Selling the option retains its time value.

Thus, their price bounds are the same as European calls:
$$
C \geq \max(S_0 - K e^{-rT}, 0)
$$

### American Put Options (Non-Dividend Paying Stocks)

**Early exercise may be optimal**, especially when deep in the money:

- **Immediate value realization**: $K - S_0$ can be collected now.
- **Time value of money**: Receiving proceeds sooner is preferable.
- **Stock price limitations**: Since $S_0 \geq 0$, the put’s value is capped.

Thus, the lower bound for American puts is adjusted:
$$
P \geq \max(K - S_0, 0)
$$

## Put-Call Parity

Put-call parity establishes a fundamental relationship between European call and put
options with the same strike price and expiration. It ensures pricing consistency in the
absence of arbitrage opportunities.

### Put-Call Parity for Non-Dividend Paying Stocks

Consider two equivalent portfolios:

- **Portfolio A**: A European call option ($c$) and a zero-coupon bond paying $K$ at
expiration.
- **Portfolio B**: A European put option ($p$) and the underlying stock ($S_0$).

At expiration ($T$), both portfolios yield the same payoff:

|             |                  | $S_T > K$ (Above Strike) | $S_T < K$ (Below Strike) |
| ----------- | ---------------- | :----------------------: | :----------------------: |
| Portfolio A | Call option      |       $S_T - K$          |          $0$             |
|             | Zero-coupon bond |          $K$             |          $K$             |
|             | **Total**        |         $S_T$            |          $K$             |
| Portfolio B | Put Option       |          $0$             |       $K - S_T$          |
|             | Share            |         $S_T$            |         $S_T$            |
|             | **Total**        |         $S_T$            |          $K$             |

Since both portfolios must have the same present value, we get the **put-call parity
equation**:
$$
c + K e^{-rT} = p + S_0
$$

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Arbitrage Opportunities via Put-Call Parity

Consider an example where $S_0 = \$31$, $r = 10\%$, the call option price $c = \$3$, and
the strike price $K = \$30$. The table outlines potential arbitrage strategies based on
discrepancies in put option pricing, illustrating the mechanism for securing risk-free
profits by leveraging the put-call parity principle.

| Three-month put price = \$2.25      | Three-month put price = \$1         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| *Action now:*                       | *Action now:*                       |
| Buy call for \$3                    | Borrow \$29 for 3 months            |
| Short put to realize \$2.25         | Short call to realize \$3           |
| Short the stock to realize \$31     | Buy put for \$1                     |
| Invest \$30.25 for 3 months         | Buy the stock for \$31              |
| ...                                 |                                     |
| *Action in 3 months if* $S_T > 30$: | *Action in 3 months if* $S_T > 30$: |
| Receive \$31.02 from investment     | Call exercised: sell stock for \$30 |
| Exercise call to buy stock for \$30 | Use \$29.73 to repay loan           |
| Net profit = \$1.02                 | Net profit = \$0.27                 |
| ...                                 |                                     |
| *Action in 3 months if* $S_T < 30$: | *Action in 3 months if* $S_T < 30$: |
| Receive \$31.02 from investment     | Exercise put to sell stock for \$30 |
| Put exercised: buy stock for \$30   | Use \$29.73 to repay loan           |
| Net profit = \$1.02                 | Net profit = \$0.27                 |
:::

### Extension to American Options

Put-call parity strictly applies to **European** options. However, for **American**
options, which allow early exercise, the pricing relationship is bounded by:

$$
S_0 - K \leq C - P \leq S_0 - K e^{-rT}
$$

This range accounts for the added flexibility of early exercise, particularly for
American put options, which may be exercised early if deep in the money.

## Effect of Dividends on Options

Dividends impact option valuation and exercise strategies, particularly for **American
call options**. The present value of expected dividends over the option's life is
denoted as **$D$**. Understanding the impact of dividends is crucial for accurate option
pricing and strategic decision-making.

- **Dividends reduce call option value** due to lost dividend income.

- **Dividends increase put option value** as they lower the stock price.

- For **American call options**, early exercise is typically suboptimal. However, if a
dividend is expected, it may be beneficial to **exercise just before the ex-dividend
date** to capture the dividend payout. Apart from this scenario, early exercise remains
suboptimal.

### Adjusted Lower Bound Valuations

Dividends modify the lower bounds of option prices:

- **Call Options:** The lower bound decreases since early exercise forfeits dividends:
$$
c \geq S_0 - D - K e^{-rT}
$$
- **Put Options:** The lower bound increases, as dividends reduce the stock price:
$$
p \geq D + K e^{-rT} - S_0
$$

### Adjusted Put-Call Parity with Dividends

Dividends also modify the **put-call parity** relationship:

- **European Options with Dividends**:
$$
c + D + K e^{-rT} = p + S_0
$$
- **American Options with Dividends**:
$$
S_0 - D - K < C - P < S_0 - K e^{-rT}
$$
