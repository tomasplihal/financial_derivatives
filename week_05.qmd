## Understanding Options

:::{.callout-tip}
# Definition

Options are financial derivatives that offer the buyer the **right, but not the
obligation**, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a
predetermined price (strike price) on or before a specified date. The seller of the
option, also known as the writer, receives a premium from the buyer in exchange for this
right. 
:::

#### Types of Options

- **Call Option**: Grants the holder the right to purchase an asset at the strike price
by the expiration date. It is a bullish bet, with the buyer anticipating an increase in
the asset's price.

```{python}
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import numpy as np

# Parameters
S = 100  # Strike price of the option
Q = 1  # Quantity of the asset
spot_prices = np.linspace(80, 120, 100)  # Range of spot prices
premium = 5  # Option premium

# Payoff calculations for call options
long_call_profit = np.maximum(spot_prices - S, 0) * Q - premium
short_call_profit = -np.maximum(spot_prices - S, 0) * Q + premium

- **Put Option**: Provides the holder the right to sell an asset at the strike price by
the expiration date. It represents a bearish outlook, where the buyer expects the
asset's price to decline.

```{python}
# Parameters
S = 100  # Strike price of the option
Q = 1  # Quantity of the asset
spot_prices = np.linspace(80, 120, 100)  # Range of spot prices
premium = 5  # Option premium

#### Execution Styles

- **American Option**: Characterized by the flexibility it offers, an American option
can be exercised at any point up until its expiration. This feature provides the holder
with the opportunity to respond to market movements and exercise the option when it is
most advantageous.

- **European Option**: This option type can only be exercised on its expiration date,
not before. The restriction on early exercise makes European options more predictable in
terms of their valuation, but it limits the holder's flexibility in responding to market
changes.

## Option Payoffs and Profits

### Understanding Option Payoffs

- **$S_T$**: Represents the price of the underlying asset at the expiration date $T$.
- **$K$**: Denotes the exercise or strike price of the option.

The payoff to the option buyer, whether for a call or put, depends on the relationship
between the strike price $K$ and the underlying asset's price at expiration $S_T$:

- **Call Option Payoff**: $c_T = \max(0, S_T - K)$
- **Put Option Payoff**: $p_T = \max(0, K - S_T)$

:::{.callout-note}
# Example: Option Payoff

Given an underlying asset price at expiration $S_T$ of \$28 and a strike price $K$ of
\$25, the payoffs for call and put options are calculated as follows:

- **Call Buyer Payoff**: $c_T = \max(0, \$28 - \$25) = \$3$
- **Put Buyer Payoff**: $p_T = \max(0, \$25 - \$28) = \$0$
:::

- The call option is **in the money** as it has a positive payoff of \$3.
- The put option is **out of the money**, resulting in zero payoff, indicating that
exercising the option is not advantageous.

### Calculating Option Profit

The profit from an option trade must account for the option premium paid upfront ($c_0$
for calls and $p_0$ for puts). Thus, profit formulas are adjusted as follows:

- **Profit for Call Buyer**: $\Pi_{call} = \max(0, S_T - K) - c_0$
- **Profit for Put Buyer**: $\Pi_{put} = \max(0, K - S_T) - p_0$

:::{.callout-note}
# Example: Option Profit

Considering CBX stock options with a strike price $K = \$30$, where the call and put
premiums are \$1 and \$2 respectively, and the stock price at expiration $S_T$ is
\$27.50:

- **Call Option Profit**: $\Pi_{call} = \max(0, \$27.5 - \$30) - \$1 = -\$1$
- **Put Option Profit**: $\Pi_{put} = \max(0, \$30 - \$27.5) - \$2 = \$0.5$
:::

- The call option buyer incurs a loss of \$1, as the call's intrinsic value does not
offset the premium paid.
- The put option buyer realizes a profit of \$0.5, indicating that the intrinsic value
exceeds the premium paid, making the option trade beneficial despite the underlying
asset's price movement.

## Other Option Characteristics, Adjustments, and Related Assets

### Other Option Characteristics

Options are versatile financial instruments with various characteristics that cater to
different investment strategies and risk profiles. They can be based on a wide range of
underlying assets and come with specific features that define their contractual terms.

- Selling options requires posting margin due to the potential obligation to fulfill the
contract.

#### Specification of Exchange-Traded Options

Options can be written on **various assets**, providing flexibility and diversity in
investment choices:

- Stocks
- ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products)
- Foreign Currency
- Stock Indices
- Futures

Key specifications include:

- **Expiration Date**: The last date the option can be exercised.
- **Strike Price**: The price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold.
- **Option Style**: European (exercisable only at expiration) or American (exercisable
any time before expiration).
- **Option Class**: Call (right to buy) or Put (right to sell).

#### Option Value

- **Intrinsic Value**: The profit that could be realized if the option were exercised
immediately.
- **Time Value**: The additional value reflecting the potential for the option to gain
intrinsic value before expiration.

**Moneyness** describes the intrinsic value of an option in its current state:

- **At-the-Money**: The option's strike price is equal to the underlying asset's current
price.
- **In-the-Money**: The option would have positive intrinsic value if exercised now.
- **Out-of-the-Money**: The option has no intrinsic value (only time value).

### Dividends and Stock Splits Adjustments

- **Cash Dividends**: Typically, option contracts are not adjusted for cash dividends.
The reasoning behind this is that cash dividends are expected events, and their
potential impact is already factored into the option's price through market mechanisms.

- **Stock Splits and Stock Dividends**: These corporate actions directly affect the
company's stock price and, consequently, the value of options on that stock. To preserve
the value of existing options, adjustments are made to both the strike price ($K$) and
the number of options ($N$) held.

For an $n$-for-$m$ stock split, adjustments are made as follows:

1. **Strike Price Adjustment**: The new strike price is calculated using the formula
$\frac{m}{n} \times K$. This adjustment ensures that the economic value of the strike
price relative to the stock price remains constant.

2. **Number of Options Adjustment**: The quantity of options held is recalibrated to
$\frac{n}{m} \times N$. This change ensures that the overall exposure of the option
holder remains unchanged.

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}
# Examples: Option Adjustments

#### Adjustments for a 2-for-1 Stock Split

A call option to buy 100 shares at \$20 per share.

- **Strike Price**: Becomes $\frac{1}{2} \times \$20 = \$10$.
- **Number of Options**: Increases to $\frac{2}{1} \times 100 = 200$ options.

- **2-for-1 Stock Split**: This split essentially doubles the number of shares in
circulation, halving the stock price. To maintain the option's value, the strike price
is halved, and the number of options is doubled.

#### Adjustments for a 5% Stock Dividend

A call option to buy 100 shares at \$20 per share.

- **Strike Price**: Adjusts to $\frac{1}{1.05} \times \$20 = \$19.05$.
- **Number of Options**: Increases to $\frac{1.05}{1} \times 100 = 105$ options.

- **5% Stock Dividend**: This dividend increases the number of shares by 5%, slightly
reducing the stock price. The option's strike price is adjusted to reflect the new
price, and the number of options is increased by 5% to maintain the holder's position
value.
:::

### Related Assets

#### Warrants

- Issued by corporations or financial institutions, warrants give the right to buy the
issuer's stock at a specific price before expiration.
- The exercise of warrants typically leads to the issuance of new stock.

#### Employee Stock Options

- A form of compensation for employees, usually at-the-money when issued.
- Exercise leads to the issuance of new company stock at the strike price.

#### Convertible Bonds

- Bonds that can be converted into a predetermined amount of the company's equity at
certain times during its life.
- Often callable, allowing the issuer to force conversion under specified conditions.

## Understanding the Dynamics of Option Pricing

In the realm of financial derivatives, stock options are pivotal instruments whose
valuation intricately hinges on multiple underlying factors. The valuation dynamics of
these options can be dissected into several key variables, each exerting a distinct
influence under the ceteris paribus (all else equal) assumption. Herein, we delineate
the impact of these variables on the prices of European and American options, using the
following notations to denote directional influences: a positive ($+$) impact suggests
that an increase in the variable elevates the option's price, a negative ($-$) impact
denotes a price decrease, and an uncertain ($?$) relationship indicates an ambiguous
effect.

|          Variable          | European Call | European Put | American Call | American Put |
| :------------------------: | :-----------: | :----------: | :-----------: | :----------: |
|    Current Stock Price ($S_0$)    |      $+$      |     $-$      |      $+$      |     $-$      |
|        Strike Price ($K$)        |      $-$      |     $+$      |      $-$      |     $+$      |
|     Time to Expiration ($T$)     |      $?$      |     $?$      |      $+$      |     $+$      |
|         Volatility ($\sigma$)         |      $+$      |     $+$      |      $+$      |     $+$      |
|       Risk-free Rate ($r$)       |      $+$      |     $-$      |      $+$      |     $-$      |
| Amount of Future Dividends ($D$) |      $-$      |     $+$      |      $-$      |     $+$      |

To ensure clarity in discourse, we employ the following notations throughout:

- $c$: Price of a European call option
- $p$: Price of a European put option
- $C$: Price of an American call option
- $P$: Price of an American put option
- $S_0$: Current stock price
- $S_T$: Stock price at option maturity
- $K$: Strike price
- $T$: Option's life span
- $\sigma$: Volatility of the stock price
- $D$: Present value of dividends disbursed during the option's life
- $r$: Risk-free interest rate with continuous compounding over maturity $T$

### Comparative Analysis of American and European Options

A pivotal aspect of option theory is the intrinsic value comparison between American and
European options. American options, characterized by their flexibility of exercise prior
to expiration, inherently command a value that is not less than their European
counterparts, which are exercisable only at maturity. This valuation principle is
succinctly encapsulated in the following inequalities:

$$ C \geq c $$
$$ P \geq p $$

These relations underscore a fundamental valuation floor for American options, driven by
their enhanced exercise flexibility. This comparative analysis not only enriches our
understanding of option pricing dynamics but also accentuates the critical role of
exercise timing in option valuation.

## Upper and Lower Bounds for Option Prices

### Upper Boundaries for Option Valuations

#### Call Options

For both American and European call options, the principle that an option's value cannot
exceed the current price of the underlying stock is fundamental. Mathematically, this is
represented as:
$$ c \leq S_0 \text{ and } C \leq S_0 $$

This ceiling on call option prices prevents the possibility of arbitrage profits that
could arise from buying the stock outright and selling the call option, thereby
exploiting price discrepancies.

#### Put Options

The valuation cap for put options varies between American and European styles due to
their exercise terms.

- **American Put Options:** The value is naturally capped at the strike price, $K$,
because the option grants the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at $K$.
Thus, $P \leq K$.

- **European Put Options:** The maximum value is the present value of the strike price,
$P \leq K e^{-rT}$, considering that it can only be exercised at maturity. This prevents
arbitrage opportunities involving writing the option and investing the proceeds at the
risk-free rate.

### Lower Boundaries for Option Prices

#### European Call Options

For a European call option on a stock that does not pay dividends, the price floor is
determined by the difference between the stock's current price and the present value of
the strike price:
$$S_0 - K e^{-rT}$$

This lower bound highlights the intrinsic value of the option, beyond which arbitrage
becomes viable.

:::{.callout-note}
# Example
Given $S_0 = 20$, $T = 1$ year, $r = 10\%$ annual interest rate, and $K = 18$, the lower
bound calculation yields \$3.71. If the market price of the call option is \$3, an
arbitrage opportunity exists by shorting the stock, buying the call, and investing the
proceeds at the 10% rate.

- $S_0 = 20$, $T = 1$, $r = 10\%$, $K = 18$, $D = 0$

$$S_0 - K e^{-rT} = 20 - 18 e^{-0.1} = 3.71$$

- What if the European call price is \$3?
- An arbitrageur can short the stock, buy the call, and invest proceeds at 10%.
:::

#### European Put Options

The lower bound for a European put option, similarly on a non-dividend-paying stock, is
the present value of the strike price minus the current stock price:
$$K e^{-rT} - S_0$$

This calculation ensures that the option's price reflects its minimum economic value.

:::{.callout-note}
# Example
With $S_0 = 37$, $T = 0.5$ years, $r = 5\%$, and $K = 40$, the lower bound is \$2.01. If
the market price is \$1, arbitrage is possible by borrowing \$38 for 6 months to
purchase both the stock and the put option.

- $S_0 = 37$, $T = 0.5$, $r = 5\%$, $K = 40$, $D = 0$ 

$$K e^{-rT} - S_0 = 40 e^{-0.05 \times 0.5} - 37 = 2.01$$

- What if the European put price is \$1?
- An arbitrageur can borrow \$38 for 6 months to buy both the put and the stock.
:::

### American Options and Early Exercise Decision

#### American Call Options on Non-dividend Paying Stocks

The conventional wisdom suggests that **it is suboptimal to exercise an American call
option on a non-dividend paying stock before expiration**. Consider an American call
option with the following parameters: $S_0 = 100$, $T = 0.25$, $K = 60$, and $D = 0$.
The dilemma of whether to exercise the option immediately hinges on the anticipated
utility from holding the stock versus the option.

- **If intending to hold the stock:** Exercising early forfeits the call option's time
value, providing no additional benefit over holding the option.

- **If intending to close the stock position:** Selling the option is preferable,
capturing both its intrinsic and time value, unlike exercising, which yields only the
intrinsic value.

- **Justifications Against Early Exercise:**
    - **Preservation of Capital:** Delaying the exercise preserves liquidity by
    deferring the payment of the strike price.
    - **Insurance Benefit:** The option acts as a hedge against the stock's depreciation
    below the strike price.
    - **Maximization of Value:** Selling the option rather than exercising it realizes
    both intrinsic and time value.

- Because it is not optimal to exercise an American stock option on a
non-dividend-paying stock early, the upper and lower bounds will be the same as those
for European options.

#### American Put Options on Non-dividend Paying Stocks

Contrary to calls, American put options on non-dividend paying stocks **may warrant early
exercise**, especially when deeply in the money, due to the immediate gain realization and
the time value of money.

Imagine a scenario where the strike price is \$10, and the stock price plummets near
zero. Immediate exercise yields a \$10 gain, maximizing the investor's return as stock
prices cannot become negative and due to the preference for current versus future value.

- **Justifications for Early Exercise:**
    - **Immediate Value Realization:** Exercising deep in-the-money puts captures the
    maximum possible gain immediately.
    - **Time Value of Money:** Receiving proceeds today is financially more beneficial
    than an identical future payment due to potential investment returns.
    - **Decreased Attractiveness with Stock Price Decline:** As $S_0$ diminishes, the
    attractiveness of early exercise increases, especially under higher interest rates
    and lower volatility.

- Because it may be optimal in some cases to exercise an American put option early, the
**lower bound** changes accordingly:

$$P \geq \max(K - S_0, 0)$$

### Summary of Price Boundaries

The upper and lower price limits for options serve as critical indicators for arbitrage
strategies and investment analysis. They are succinctly summarized as follows:

#### Call Options

The upper bound is the stock's current price, while the lower bound is either the
difference between the stock's price and the discounted strike price or zero, whichever
is greater.

- Upper bound for European and American call options:

  $$c \leq S_0 \text{ and } C \leq S_0$$

- Lower bound for European and American call option:

$$c \geq \max(S_0 - K e^{-rT}, 0)$$
$$C \geq \max(S_0 - K e^{-rT}, 0)$$

#### Put Options

The upper bound for European options is the discounted strike price, while for American
options, it's the strike price itself. The lower bound is the greater of the discounted
strike price minus the stock's price or zero.

- Upper bound for European and American put options:

$$p \leq K e^{-rT} \text{ and } P \leq K$$

- Lower bound for European and American put option:

$$p \geq \max(K e^{-rT} - S_0, 0)$$

$$P \geq \max(K - S_0, 0)$$

## Put-Call Parity

The principle of put-call parity is a cornerstone in the theoretical framework of
financial derivatives, providing a fundamental relationship between the prices of
European call and put options. This parity underlines the equilibrium that must exist
between these options when they have identical strike prices and expiration dates.
Below, we delve deeper into the concept, illustrating its implications for both
non-dividend and dividend-paying stocks, and extend the discussion to American options.

### Put-Call Parity for Non-dividend Paying Stocks

Consider two distinct portfolios, A and B, each composed of different financial
instruments but constructed to have equivalent values at the expiration of the options
involved:

- **Portfolio A** consists of a European call option and a zero-coupon bond paying $K$
(the strike price) at time $T$ (expiration).
- **Portfolio B** includes a European put option and the underlying stock itself.

The table below presents the values of these portfolios at option expiration under two
scenarios: when the stock price at expiration, $S_T$, is above or below the strike
price, $K$.

|             |                  | $S_T > K$ (Above Strike) | $S_T < K$ (Below Strike) |
| ----------- | ---------------- | :----------------------: | :----------------------: |
| Portfolio A | Call option      |       $S_T - K$          |          $0$             |
|             | Zero-coupon bond |          $K$             |          $K$             |
|             | **Total**        |         $S_T$            |          $K$             |
| Portfolio B | Put Option       |          $0$             |       $K - S_T$          |
|             | Share            |         $S_T$            |         $S_T$            |
|             | **Total**        |         $S_T$            |          $K$             |

Given their identical payouts at maturity, both portfolios must have the same present
value, leading to the foundational put-call parity equation:

$$c + K e^{-rT} = p + S_0$$

### Arbitrage Opportunities via Put-Call Parity

Consider an example where $S_0 = \$31$, $r = 10\%$, the call option price $c = \$3$, and
the strike price $K = \$30$. The table outlines potential arbitrage strategies based on
discrepancies in put option pricing, illustrating the mechanism for securing risk-free
profits by leveraging the put-call parity principle.

| Three-month put price = \$2.25      | Three-month put price = \$1         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| *Action now:*                       | *Action now:*                       |
| Buy call for \$3                    | Borrow \$29 for 3 months            |
| Short put to realize \$2.25         | Short call to realize \$3           |
| Short the stock to realize \$31     | Buy put for \$1                     |
| Invest \$30.25 for 3 months         | Buy the stock for \$31              |
| ...                                 |                                     |
| *Action in 3 months if* $S_T > 30$: | *Action in 3 months if* $S_T > 30$: |
| Receive \$31.02 from investment     | Call exercised: sell stock for \$30 |
| Exercise call to buy stock for \$30 | Use \$29.73 to repay loan           |
| Net profit = \$1.02                 | Net profit = \$0.27                 |
| ...                                 |                                     |
| *Action in 3 months if* $S_T < 30$: | *Action in 3 months if* $S_T < 30$: |
| Receive \$31.02 from investment     | Exercise put to sell stock for \$30 |
| Put exercised: buy stock for \$30   | Use \$29.73 to repay loan           |
| Net profit = \$1.02                 | Net profit = \$0.27                 |

### Extension to American Options

While put-call parity directly applies to European options, its principles offer insight
into the valuation boundaries of American options, which can be exercised at any time
before expiration. In the absence of dividends, the relationship between American call
and put prices can be expressed as:

$$ S_0 - K \leq C - P \leq S_0 - Ke^{-rT} $$

This range provides a basis for evaluating the relative pricing of American calls and
puts, emphasizing the influence of early exercise rights and the absence of dividend
payments on option valuation.

## Effect of Dividends on Options

The presence of dividends within the lifespan of an option introduces significant
nuances to the valuation and strategic exercise decisions of options. This section
delves into how known dividends impact the valuation of options, adjusting the
traditional models to accommodate the dividend factor.

When dividends are anticipated during the option's term, they must be factored into the
option's present value. We denote the present value of expected dividends during the
option's life as $D$. The ex-dividend date marks the occasion for these adjustments,
impacting the strategic exercise decisions for American call options.

The prospect of dividends alters the conventional wisdom that American call options
should not be exercised early. Specifically, it may become optimal to exercise these
options just before the ex-dividend date to capture the dividend payout.

**Crucial Point:** Apart from the period just before the ex-dividend date, early
exercise of a call option remains suboptimal.

### Adjusting Lower Bound Valuations for Dividends

The introduction of dividends necessitates a revision of the lower bound calculations
for both call and put option prices:

- **For Call Options:** The lower bound formula adjusts to account for the dividend's
negative impact on the option's value, reflecting the loss of dividend income upon early
exercise:
$$c \geq S_0 - D - K e^{-rT}$$

- **For Put Options:** Conversely, the lower bound for put options incorporates
dividends positively, indicating an increase in value due to the potential decrease in
the underlying stock's price upon dividend payout:
$$p \geq D + K e^{-rT} - S_0$$

### Revising Put-Call Parity with Dividends

The presence of dividends also modifies the put-call parity relationship, a fundamental
principle in options pricing:

- **European Options with Dividends:** The parity formula integrates $D$ to balance the
equation, highlighting the direct impact of dividends on the call option's lower
valuation compared to its put counterpart:
$$c + D + K e^{-rT} = p + S_0$$

- **American Options with Dividends:** When dividends are present, the valuation bounds
for American options adjust to reflect the diminished value of the call option due to
potential early exercise for dividend capture:
$$S_0 - D - K < C - P < S_0 - K e^{-rT}$$

Dividends play a pivotal role in the strategic exercise and valuation of options,
particularly affecting American call options' early exercise decisions. Adjusting option
valuation models to account for dividends is essential for accurate pricing and
effective investment strategy formulation.

## Practice Questions and Problems

### Option Profitability and Exercise Conditions

1. Suppose that a European call option to buy a share for \$100.00 costs \$5.00 and is
held until maturity. Under what circumstances will the holder of the option make a
profit? Under what circumstances will the option be exercised? Draw a diagram
illustrating how the profit from a long position in the option depends on the stock
price at maturity of the option.
2. An investor sells a European call on a share for \$4. The stock price is \$47 and the
strike price is \$50. Under what circumstances does the investor make a profit? Under
what circumstances will the option be exercised? Draw a diagram showing the variation of
the investor's profit with the stock price at the maturity of the option.
3. An investor buys a European put on a share for \$3. The stock price is \$42 and the
strike price is \$40. Under what circumstances does the investor make a profit? Under
what circumstances will the option be exercised? Draw a diagram showing the variation of
the investor's profit with the stock price at the maturity of the option.
4. Suppose that a European put option to sell a share for \$60 costs \$8 and is held
until maturity. Under what circumstances will the seller of the option (the party with
the short position) make a profit? Under what circumstances will the option be
exercised? Draw a diagram illustrating how the profit from a short position in the
option depends on the stock price at maturity of the option.

### Margin Requirements, Market Choices, and Contract Adjustments

5. Explain why margin accounts are required when clients write options but not when they
buy options.
6. A corporate treasurer is designing a hedging program involving foreign currency
options. What are the pros and cons of using (a) the NASDAQ OMX and (b) the
over-the-counter market for trading?
7. The treasurer of a corporation is trying to choose between options and forward
contracts to hedge the corporation's foreign exchange risk. Discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of each.
8. Consider an exchange-traded call option contract to buy 500 shares with a strike
price of \$40 and maturity in four months. Explain how the terms of the option contract
change when there is
    1. A 10\% stock dividend
    2. A 10\% cash dividend
    3. A 4-for-1 stock split

### Option Pricing Bounds

9. Explain why an American option is always worth at least as much as a European option
on the same asset with the same strike price and exercise date.
10. Explain why an American option is always worth at least as much as its intrinsic
value.
11. What is a lower bound for the price of a four-month call option on a
non-dividend-paying stock when the stock price is \$28, the strike price is \$25, and
the risk-free interest rate is 8\% per annum?
12. What is a lower bound for the price of a one-month European put option on a
non-dividend paying stock when the stock price is \$12, the strike price is \$15, and
the risk-free interest rate is 6\% per annum?

### Early Exercise and Put-Call Parity

13. Give at least two reasons that the early exercise of an American call option on a
non-dividend-paying stock is not optimal.
14. The early exercise of an American put is a trade-off between the time value of money
and the insurance value of a put. Explain this statement.
15. The price of a non-dividend paying stock is \$19 and the price of a three-month
European call option on the stock with a strike price of \$20 is
\$1. The risk-free rate is 4\% per annum. What is the price of a three-month European
put option with a strike price of \$20?
16. List and explain the six factors affecting stock option prices.
