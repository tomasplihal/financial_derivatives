## Pricing and Valuation of Forward/Futures Contracts

- **Pricing** determines the fair market rate at contract **initiation**, ensuring
neutrality for both parties.  

- **Valuation** assesses the contract's value **after initiation**, fluctuating based on
market conditions.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Example: Forward Price vs. Value

- On November 2, an investor takes a **long position** in a December Gold futures
contract at **$1,250/oz**. At initiation, the contract.s value is **$0** (fair market
agreement).  
- On November 3, if the market price drops to **$1,225/oz**, the contract's value turns
**negative**, reflecting a loss for the investor.
:::

- **Risk Aversion:** Investors require compensation for taking on additional risk,
reflecting the principle that higher risk should be rewarded with higher potential
returns.

- **Risk-Neutral Pricing:** Under this approach, it's assumed that investors are
indifferent to risk. The pricing of derivatives through arbitrage opportunities ensures
that the portfolio, combining the derivative and its underlying asset, yields the
risk-free rate of return.

- **Arbitrage-Free Pricing:** This methodology prices derivatives based on the
assumption that the market operates under risk-neutral conditions and is free of
arbitrage opportunities, ensuring no risk-free profits can be made from market
inefficiencies.

- **Law of One Price:** asserts that identical cash flows must have the same price,
irrespective of future outcomes.

- **Arbitrage Principles:**
  1. Do not use your own money.
  2. Do not take any price risk.

- **Short Selling:** Short selling involves selling borrowed securities, aiming to
repurchase them at a lower price. Sellers must cover dividends and borrowing fees.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Example: Short Selling

Short 100 shares at **$100 each** and close the position at **$90**, while a
**$3/share** dividend is issued:

- **Profit Calculation:**  
$$
100 \times (100 - 90 - 3) = 700
$$
- If instead you buy 100 shares, a price drop results in a loss:  
$$
100 \times (90 - 100 + 3) = -700
$$
:::

- **Investment Assets:**  Held for potential value appreciation over time (e.g., gold,
stocks, bonds).  

- **Consumption Assets:** Used in production or consumption (e.g., oil, copper).  

## Forward Price for an Investment Asset

**Assumptions:**

1. No transaction costs in trading.  
2. All net trading profits are taxed equally.  
3. Borrowing and lending occur at the same **risk-free interest rate**.  
4. Arbitrage opportunities are **immediately** exploited.

**Notation:**

- $S_0$: Current spot price of the asset.
- $F_0$: Today's futures or forward price of the asset.
- $T$: Time to contract maturity (in years).
- $r$: Annualized risk-free interest rate over $T$.

### Arbitrage Example  

Consider an asset that provides with **no income**, priced at **\$40**, with a **5%
annual interest rate** and a **3-month forward contract**.

#### Case 1: Forward Price = /$43  

- **Now**: Borrow \$40, buy the asset, and enter a forward contract to sell at \$43.  
- **In 3 months**: Sell at \$43, repay the loan (\$40.50 with interest).  
- **Profit**: \$2.50.

#### Case 2: Forward Price = \$39  

- **Now**: Short sell the asset for \$40, invest the proceeds at 5% interest, and enter
a forward contract to buy at \$39.  
- **In 3 months**: Buy back at \$39, close the short position, and receive \$40.50 from
the investment.  
- **Profit**: \$1.50.

### Forward Price Formula

For an **investment asset** with **no income**, the no-arbitrage forward price is:

$$
F_0 = S_0 e^{rT}
$$

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Example: Eliminate arbitrage

Using $S_0 = 40$, $T = 0.25$ (3 months), and $r = 0.05$ (5%):

$$
F_0 = 40 e^{0.05 \times 0.25} = 40.50
$$

This aligns with the **theoretical fair price**, ensuring no arbitrage.
:::

- If the asset generates a **known income** $I$ (expressed as the present value of the
income), the formula adjusts to:  

$$
F_0 = (S_0 - I)e^{rT}
$$

- If the asset provides a **yield** $q$ (expressed as a continuously compounded
annualized rate):  

$$
F_0 = S_0 e^{(r - q)T}
$$

## Valuing a Forward Contract  

At initiation, a forward contract has **zero value**, ensuring fairness for both parties
(excluding bid-offer spreads). Over time, its value can become **positive or negative**
as market conditions change.  

Let:  

- $K$ = **Agreed delivery price** in the contract.  
- $F_0$ = **Forward price** for a contract negotiated today.  

The value of a forward contract depends on the difference between the agreed **delivery
price** and the current **forward price**, discounted at the risk-free rate:  

- **Long position (buying the asset):**  
$$
V_{\text{long}} = (F_0 - K) e^{-rT}
$$

- **Short position (selling the asset):**  
$$
V_{\text{short}} = - (F_0 - K) e^{-rT}
$$

These formulas show how the **risk-free rate $r$** and **time to maturity $T$** impact
the present value of expected gains or losses.  

## Forward vs. Futures Prices  

Although **forward** and **futures** contracts both involve agreeing to buy/sell an
asset at a future date, their prices may diverge due to **interest rate volatility**.  

- If interest rates and asset prices are **positively correlated** $\rightarrow$
**Futures price** > **Forward price**  
  - Daily settlement allows gains to be reinvested at **higher rates**.  

- If interest rates and asset prices are **negatively correlated** $\rightarrow$
**Futures price** < **Forward price**  
  - No daily settlement avoids reinvesting at **lower rates**.  

One notable example is **Eurodollar futures**, where pricing anomalies arise due to
unique market characteristics.  

## Forward Price for Specific Assets  

### Stock Index  

A **stock index** is an **investment asset** that effectively pays a **dividend yield**,
similar to the income generated by holding its underlying stocks.  

The relationship between the **futures price** ($F_0$) and the **spot price** ($S_0$)
is:

$$
F_0 = S_0 e^{(r-q)T}
$$

where, $q$ represents the average dividend yield of the portfolio reflected by the index
over the contract's life.

:::{.callout-warning}
This formula assumes the index represents a **tradable investment asset**. However, a
purely numerical index (e.g., **Nikkei 225** without its underlying assets) does not
qualify as a true investment asset.  
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Index Arbitrage  

Arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies between **futures** and **spot prices**
adjusted for dividend yield and the risk-free rate:  

- If $F_0 > S_0 e^{(r-q)T} \rightarrow$ Buy the underlying stocks, sell futures.  
- If $F_0 < S_0 e^{(r-q)T} \rightarrow$ Buy futures, short-sell the index’s underlying
stocks.  

High-frequency trading algorithms often execute these strategies. However, **real-world
frictions** (e.g., execution delays, transaction costs) may prevent perfect arbitrage.  
:::

### Exchange Rates  

A **foreign currency** behaves like a security yielding **interest**, where the yield is
the **foreign risk-free rate** ($r_f$). The forward exchange rate is given by:  

$$
F_0 = S_0 e^{(r - r_f)T}
$$

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
# Exchange Rate Arbitrage  

Consider two equivalent strategies for converting **1,000 units** of a foreign currency
into dollars by time $T$:  

1. **Invest in the foreign currency** at rate $r_f$, then convert at the forward rate $F_0$.  
2. **Convert immediately** at spot rate $S_0$, then invest in dollars at rate $r$.  

No-arbitrage implies both must yield the same result, leading to:  

$$
1,000 \times e^{r_f T} \times F_0 = 1,000 \times S_0 \times e^{rT}
$$

Solving for $F_0$ confirms the forward rate formula:

$$
F_0 = S_0 e^{(r - r_f)T}
$$
:::

### Commodities  

For **consumption assets** (e.g., oil, wheat, copper), **storage costs** act as
**negative income**, affecting forward pricing:  

$$
F_0 \leq S_0 e^{(r + u)T}
$$

where:  

- $u$ = **Storage cost per unit time** as a percentage of the asset’s value.  

Alternatively, if $U$ represents the **present value** of storage costs:  

$$
F_0 \leq (S_0 + U) e^{rT}
$$

These formulas accommodate the costs associated with holding and storing physical
commodities, from agricultural products to metals, affecting their forward pricing.

### The Cost of Carry  

The **cost of carry** ($c$) represents the total cost of holding an asset, including:  

- Storage costs
- Financing costs
- Income earned (e.g., dividends, yields)

For **investment assets**, the forward price follows:  

$$
F_0 = S_0 e^{cT}
$$

For **consumption assets**, storage and financing costs may create **lower price bounds**:  

$$
F_0 \leq S_0 e^{cT}
$$

A **convenience yield** ($y$) represents the **benefit of physically holding** a
consumption asset rather than a derivative. The forward price adjusts to:  

$$
F_0 = S_0 e^{(c - y)T}
$$

where $y$ reflects **scarcity, supply-chain security, and non-financial benefits** of
physical possession.  

## Futures Prices and Expected Spot Prices  

- **Contango** ($F_t > S_t$): Futures prices are higher than the current or expected
future spot price.  
  - Occurs when carrying costs (storage, interest) exceed convenience yield.  
  - Common in gold, silver, natural gas, and agricultural commodities.  
  - Contango is more common across most futures markets due to carrying costs.

- **Backwardation** ($F_t < S_t$): Futures prices are lower than the expected future
spot price.  
  - Happens when convenience yield is high (scarcity or strong demand for immediate
  delivery).  
  - Common in crude oil, perishable goods, and equity index futures.  

- **Futures prices are poor predictors of future spot prices.** Empirical evidence shows
biases due to risk premia and market inefficiencies. Speculative demand, liquidity
constraints, and irrational expectations can further distort pricing.  
- While futures prices provide useful signals, they should not be relied upon as perfect
forecasts of future spot prices.

## Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)  

An **FRA** is a financial contract where parties exchange a **fixed interest rate** for
a **floating rate** (e.g., LIBOR, SOFR, SONIA) at a future date, based on a specified
**notional principal**.  

- No principal exchange occurs—only the difference in interest payments is settled.  
- The **initial value** of an FRA is **zero** since the fixed rate equals the forward
rate at inception.  
- As the forward rate changes over time, the FRA’s value fluctuates.  

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Example: FRA

Party A and Party B agree to exchange a fixed rate of 3% for the three-month SOFR on a
\$100 million notional in two years (compounded quarterly).  

- **Party A** pays floating SOFR and receives a fixed 3%.  
- **Party B** takes the opposite position.  

If in two years the SOFR rate is 3.5%, Party A receives a payment from Party B:  

$$
100,000,000 \times (0.035 - 0.030) \times 0.25 = 125,000
$$

This amount is discounted for three months at **3.5%**, since payments are made at the
two-year mark.
:::

- A **zero rate** is the interest rate for an investment lasting $n$ years, with
interest and principal paid at maturity (no intermediate payments).  

- A **forward rate** represents the future interest rate implied by current zero rates
for future periods. It reflects the cost of borrowing/lending at a future time.

For a forward rate between $T_1$ and $T_2$, given zero rate $R_1$ and $R_2$:

$$
R_F = \frac{R_2 T_2 - R_1 T_1}{T_2 - T_1}
$$

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Example: Forward Rate Calculation  

| Year | Zero Rate (% per annum) | Forward Rate for nth Year (% per annum) |
|:----:|:----------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| 1    | 3.0                    |                                         |
| 2    | 4.0                    | 5.0                                     |
| 3    | 4.6                    | 5.8                                     |
| 4    | 5.0                    | 6.2                                     |
| 5    | 5.3                    | 6.5                                     |

For **year 4**, given $T_1 = 3$, $T_2 = 4$, $R_1 = 4.6\%$, and $R_2 = 5.0\%$:

$$
R_F = \frac{0.05 \times 4 - 0.046 \times 3}{4 - 3} = 6.2\%
$$

This forward rate (**6.2%**) is higher than the **zero rate (5.0%)**, reflecting an
**upward-sloping yield curve**.
:::

The **value of an FRA** is determined by:  

- The difference between the **agreed fixed rate** ($R_K$) and the **current forward
rate** ($R_F$).  
- The **contract period** ($t$).  
- Discounting the difference to **present value**.

15. When a known future cash outflow in a foreign currency is hedged by a company using a
forward contract, there is no foreign exchange risk. When it is hedged using futures
contracts, the daily settlement process does leave the company exposed to some risk.
Explain the nature of this risk. Assume that the forward price equals the futures price.
In particular, consider whether the company is better off using a futures contract or a
forward contract when
    - a) The value of the foreign currency falls rapidly during the life of the contract
    - b) The value of the foreign currency rises rapidly during the life of the contract
    - c) The value of the foreign currency first rises and then falls back to its
    initial value
    - d) The value of the foreign currency first falls and then rises back to its
    initial value
