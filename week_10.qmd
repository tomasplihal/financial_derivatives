## Options on Stock Indices

Options on stock indices allow investors to speculate on the direction of an entire
market index or hedge their portfolio market risk without directly transacting the
component stocks. Some of the most widely traded stock index options in the United
States are:

- **S&P 100 Index (OEX and XEO):** These options provide a broad market exposure to the
top 100 stocks in the S&P index. OEX options are American-style, allowing exercise at
any point before the expiration date, whereas XEO options are European-style,
exercisable only at expiration.
  
- **S&P 500 Index (SPX):** A benchmark index for U.S. equities, these European-style
options reflect the performance of 500 large-cap stocks and are a key tool for
institutional investors for hedging and exposure adjustment.
  
- **Dow Jones Index (DJX):** Priced at 1/100th of the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
these options are a cost-effective way to gain exposure to the movements of the Dow
Jones, consisting of 30 significant stocks.
  
- **Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX):** These European-style options represent the 100 largest
non-financial stocks from the Nasdaq, making them crucial for investors focused on
technology and innovation sectors.

All mentioned index options are exchange-traded, have their contract size set at 100
times the index value, and are settled in cash, which simplifies the transaction and
eliminates the need for physical delivery of the underlying securities.

### Using Index Options for Portfolio Insurance

Portfolio insurance is a strategy used to protect against market declines through the
use of put options. The strategy involves purchasing puts to cover potential losses in a
portfolio's value due to adverse market movements.

- **Initial Setup:** 
  - Let $S_0$ represent the current index value.
  - Let $K$ be the strike price of the put option.
  - The portfolio's beta ($\beta$) indicates its sensitivity to market movements
  relative to the index.

- **Insurance Strategy:** 
  - For a portfolio with $\beta = 1.0$, purchase one put option for every $\$100 \times
  S_0$ of portfolio value to hedge against downturns.
  - If $\beta \neq 1.0$, adjust the number of put options accordingly, purchasing
  $\beta$ options per $\$100 \times S_0$.
  - In both cases, $K$ is chosen to give the appropriate insurance level.

:::{.callout-note}
# Example: Portfolio Insurance, $\beta = 1.0$

- **Portfolio Details:**
  - Portfolio $\beta$ = 1.0
  - Portfolio Value = \$500,000
  - Current Index Value = 1,000

- **Objective:** Insure the portfolio so its value does not fall below \$450,000 in the
next three months.

- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - The manager opts to buy put options as a form of insurance. Since each contract
  covers 100 times the index value, the manager needs one put option for every \$100,000
  of the portfolio value (i.e., $500,000 / 100 \times 1,000 = 5$ put options).
  - These options have a strike price ($K$) of 900 (10\% decrease).

- **Mechanism of Insurance:**
  - If the index drops to 880 in three months, the portfolio’s expected value would
  decrease proportionately to about \$440,000.
  - The put options’ payoff can be calculated as follows:

    $$\text{Payoff} = 5 \times \left[ (900 - 880) \times 100 \right] = \$10,000$$

  - This payoff compensates for the decrease in the portfolio’s value, effectively
  bringing it up to the insured value of \$450,000.

# Example: Portfolio Insurance, $\beta \neq 1.0$

Consider a portfolio with a $\beta$ of 2.0. This high beta implies that the portfolio's
returns are expected to be twice as volatile as the underlying index's returns.
Currently, the portfolio is valued at \$500,000, while the index stands at 1,000. With a
risk-free rate of 12% per annum and a dividend yield of 4% on both the portfolio and the
index.

- **Objective:** Insure the portfolio so its value does not fall below \$450,000 in the
next three months.

- **Required Number of Contracts:** $(500,000 / 100,000) \times 2 = 10$ put option
contracts are needed.

#### Determining the Appropriate Strike Price Using CAPM Model

- **Index Return Scenario:** Assume the index rises to 1,040 in three months, reflecting
a 4% return.
- **Total Return Including Dividends:** $4\%$ (index return) + $1\%$ (dividends) = 5%.
- **Excess Return Over Risk-Free Rate:** $5\%$ - $3\%$ (equivalent quarterly risk-free
rate) = 2%.
- **Excess Return for Portfolio:** $2\% \times 2 = 4\%$ (due to beta of 2.0).
- **Net Portfolio Return Calculation:** Excess return (4%) + risk-free rate over three
months (3%) - dividend yield (1%) = 6%.
- **Projected Portfolio Value:** $\$500,000 \times 1.06 = \$530,000$.

- **Result:** Similar calculations can be carried out for other values of the index at
the end of the three months. Appropriate strike price for the 10 put option contracts
that are purchased is 960 (or 955 when we include dividends).

| Value of Index in Three Months | Value of Portfolio in Three Months (\$) |
|:------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| 1,080                          | 570,000                               |
| 1,040                          | 530,000                               |
| 1,000                          | 490,000                               |

| 920                            | 410,000                               |
| 880                            | 370,000                               |

## Valuation of Stock Index Options

The valuation of European stock index options hinges on the understanding of asset price
dynamics under different conditions. The probability distribution of the asset price at
maturity $T$ remains consistent in two distinct scenarios:
  1. When the asset originates at a price $S_0$ with a yield of $q$.
  2. When the asset starts at a discounted price of $S_0e^{-qT}$, assuming it yields no
  income.

By utilizing this equivalence, we simplify the valuation process for European options.
Instead of accounting for dividends directly, we **adjust the initial stock price** to
$S_0e^{-qT}$ and **proceed with the valuation as if the stock pays no dividends**. This
approach effectively streamlines the calculation by isolating the impact of yields and
focusing on pure price movements.

### Extending Lower Bounds and Put-Call Parity

The intrinsic value forms the lower bound for option prices, ensuring that the option
price does not fall below its immediate exercise value. These bounds are critical in
preventing arbitrage opportunities.

- **Lower Bound for Call Options:**
  $$c \geq \max (S_0 e^{-qT} - Ke^{-rT}, 0)$$

- **Lower Bound for Put Options:**
  $$p \geq \max (Ke^{-rT} - S_0 e^{-qT}, 0)$$

Put-call parity establishes a risk-neutral relationship between the prices of European
put and call options with identical strike prices and expirations.

- **Put-Call Parity**
$$c + Ke^{-rT} = p + S_0 e^{-qT}$$

### Extending Black-Scholes Model

The Black-Scholes formula for pricing European options underlies much of modern
financial derivatives trading. This extedned version considers the adjusted stock price
that accounts for divid yield ($q$). The formulas for calls and puts are as follows:

- **Call Option Price:**
  $$c = S_0 e^{-qT} N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)$$
- **Put Option Price:**
  $$p = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 e^{-qT} N(-d_1)$$

Where:
  $$d_1 = \frac{\ln (S_0 / K) + (r - q + \sigma^2 / 2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}$$
  $$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}$$

### Alternative Formulas Using Forward Prices

The valuation of European options can also be efficiently conducted using forward
prices, which simplifies the treatment of dividends and risk-free rates. This approach
directly incorporates the expected future price of the asset, eliminating the need to
adjust the current price for dividends and rates separately.

- **Call Option Price:**
  $$c = e^{-rT}[F_0 N(d_1) - K N(d_2)]$$
- **Put Option Price:**
  $$p = e^{-rT}[K N(-d_2) - F_0 N(-d_1)]$$

Where $F_0$ is the forward price of the asset, representing the expected price at time
$T$, adjusted for the risk-free rate $r$ and the dividend yield $q$. The terms $d_1$ and
$d_2$ in these formulas are modified to incorporate the forward price:

$$d_1 = \frac{\ln (F_0 / K) + \sigma^2 T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}$$
$$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}$$ 

- The forward price $F_0 = S_0 e^{(r-q)T}$ effectively encapsulates the expected growth
of the asset price due to the net effect of interest rates and dividend yields.

- This methodology is particularly useful for valuing options on assets that pay
dividends, as it directly uses the futures or forward index price, which corresponds to
a contract maturing at the same time as the option.

### Implied Forward Prices and Dividend Yields

Forward prices and dividend yields can also be derived from market prices of European
calls and puts, enabling a deeper understanding of market expectations and assisting in
strategic investment decisions.

- **Implied Forward Price:**
  $$F_0 = K + (c - p) e^{rT}$$
  This formula calculates the implied forward price from the current prices of European
  calls and puts with the same strike price and time to maturity. It reflects the
  market's expectation of the asset price at the option's expiry.

- **Implied Dividend Yield:**
  $$q = -\frac{1}{T} \ln \frac{c - p + K e^{-rT}}{S_0}$$
  This expression estimates the average dividend yield expected during the life of the
  option, derived from the observed prices of calls and puts.

- These calculations are essential for estimating term structures of forward prices and
dividend yields, particularly relevant in over-the-counter (OTC) European options.

- For American options, which can be exercised at any point up to and including the date
of expiration, understanding the term structure of dividend yields is crucial due to
their potential impact on early exercise decisions.

## Currency Options

Currency options are financial instruments that provide an essential hedging mechanism
against foreign exchange risk, utilized predominantly by corporations with international
exposure. These options are traded on structured exchanges such as NASDAQ OMX and
extensively in the over-the-counter (OTC) market, reflecting their importance in
financial risk management.

Currency as an asset class behaves similarly to stocks that provide a yield, with the
yield in this case being the foreign interest rate, $r_f$. This similarity allows the
application of stock option pricing methods to currency options, considering $r_f$ as
analogous to the dividend yield in stock options.

### Range Forward Contracts

Range forward contracts are bespoke financial agreements that help manage currency risk
by setting bounds on the exchange rate fluctuations:

- When expecting to pay currency, one typically sells a put option with a lower strike
price, $K_1$, and buys a call option with a higher strike price, $K_2$ ($K_2 > K_1$).
This structure ensures that the exchange rate remains between $K_1$ and $K_2$.

- Conversely, when expecting to receive currency, one buys a put option at $K_1$ and
sells a call option at $K_2$. 

- The cost of the put typically offsets the premium received for the call, balancing the
overall cost of the contract.

![](images/09-3-range-forwards.png)

These contracts are particularly advantageous for businesses that seek to mitigate the
risk of adverse currency movements while retaining some potential for benefiting from
favorable movements within a predetermined range.

### Extending Black-Scholes Model

Using the Black-Scholes model adjusted for currencies, we derive the following formulas:

- **Call Option Price:**
  $$c = S_0 e^{-r_f T} N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)$$

- **Put Option Price:**
  $$p = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 e^{-r_f T} N(-d_1)$$

Where:
$$d_1 = \frac{\ln (S_0 / K) + (r - r_f + \sigma^2 / 2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}$$
$$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}$$

### Alternative Formulas Using Forward Prices

The use of forward prices further simplifies the valuation by incorporating expectations
about future exchange rates:

- **Call Option Price:**
  $$c = e^{-rT}[F_0 N(d_1) - K N(d_2) ]$$
- **Put Option Price:**
  $$p = e^{-rT} [K N(-d_2) - F_0 N(-d_1)]$$

Where:
$$d_1 = \frac{\ln (F_0 / K) + \sigma^2 T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}$$
$$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}$$ 

Where $F_0 = S_0 e^{(r-r_f)T}$ represents the forward exchange rate, adjusted for the
interest rate differential between the two currencies. This model encapsulates the
market's expectations of future exchange rates, reducing the need for separate
adjustments for interest rates and foreign yields in the pricing formulas.

## Options on Futures and Black's Model

Options on futures are derivatives that confer the right, but not the obligation, to
enter into a futures contract at a predetermined price before a specified expiration
date. These options are categorized by the maturity month of the underlying futures
contract. Typically, these options are American-style, meaning they can be exercised at
any time up to and including the expiration day, which usually aligns with or occurs a
few days before the earliest delivery date of the underlying futures contract.

### Mechanics of Futures Options 

#### Call Options

When a call option on a futures contract is exercised, the holder assumes a **long
position in the futures contract**. Additionally, the holder receives a cash amount
equivalent to the difference between the futures price at the most recent settlement and
the strike price of the option.

- **Example:**
  - A September call option on copper futures has a strike price of 320 cents per pound.
  - The option is exercised when the futures price is 331 cents, with the most recent
  settlement price at 330 cents.
  - Each contract represents 25,000 pounds of copper.
  - Upon exercising, the trader receives a long position in the September futures
  contract and a cash payout of $25,000 \times 10 \text{ cents} = \$2,500$.
  - If desired, the position in the futures contract can be closed out immediately to get $25,000 \times (331 - 330) \text{ cents} = \$250$.
  - The total payoff from exercising the option is \$2,750.

#### Put Options

Conversely, when a put futures option is exercised, the holder gains a **short position
in the futures contract**. Similar to the call option, there is a cash payout which in
this case is the difference between the strike price and the futures price at the most
recent settlement.

- **Example:**
  - A December put option on corn futures has a strike price of 600 cents per bushel.
  - The option is exercised when the futures price is 580 cents per bushel, with the
  most recent settlement price at 579 cents per bushel.
  - Each contract covers 5,000 bushels.
  - The trader receives a short position in the December futures contract and a cash
  payout of $5,000 \times (600 - 579) \text{ cents} = \$1,050$.
  - If desired, the position in the futures contract can be closed out immediately to
  get $5,000 \times (579 - 580) \text{ cents} = -\$50$.
  - The total payoff from exercising the option is \$1,000.

### Payoffs of Futures Options

The payoff for futures options, if the position in the futures contract is closed out
immediately after exercising the option, is straightforward:

- **Call Option Payoff:**
  $$ \text{Payoff} = F - K $$
  Where $F$ is the futures price at the time of exercise, and $K$ is the strike price of
  the option.

- **Put Option Payoff:**
  $$ \text{Payoff} = K - F $$
  Again, $F$ represents the futures price at the time of exercise.

### Potential Advantages of Futures Options over Spot Options

Futures options offer several distinct advantages over spot options under certain
conditions:

1. **Equivalence with Spot Options:**
   - European futures options and European spot options are equivalent in value when the
   futures contract matures concurrently with the option's expiration. This equivalence
   arises because both types of options will reflect the same underlying economic
   exposures at expiration.

2. **Market Liquidity:**
   - Futures contracts often enjoy greater liquidity compared to many underlying assets,
   particularly in markets where the underlying assets are large or illiquid by nature
   (e.g., commodities, certain financial instruments). This increased liquidity
   generally makes it easier and potentially less costly to trade futures options.

3. **Settlement Characteristics:**
   - Upon exercising a futures option, the holder acquires a position in the futures
   contract rather than the immediate delivery of the underlying asset. This feature can
   be particularly advantageous in markets where physical delivery is less desirable or
   practical.

4. **Unified Trading Platforms:**
   - Futures options and the underlying futures contracts typically trade on the same
   exchange. This unification can simplify access, monitoring, and execution for traders
   and investors, enhancing market efficiency.

5. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - The transaction costs associated with trading futures options can be lower than
   those for trading spot options, largely due to standardized contract terms and
   centralized trading venues which foster more competitive pricing.

### Put-Call Parity and Lower Bounds for European Futures Options

#### Put-Call Parity

Consider the following two portfolios:

  1. European call plus $Ke^{-rT}$ of cash.
  2. European put plus long futures plus cash equal to $F_0 e^{-rT}$.

Both portfolios must be worth the same at time $T$. Therfore, for European futures
options, the put-call parity condition is expressed as:

$$c + Ke^{-rT} = p + F_0e^{-rT}$$

Here, $c$ and $p$ represent the prices of the European call and put options,
respectively, $K$ is the strike price, $F_0$ is the current futures price, and $r$ is
the risk-free interest rate. This equation ensures that no arbitrage opportunities exist
between buying a call and selling a put when adjusted for the present value of the
strike price and the futures price.

#### Lower Bounds

The lower bounds for the prices of futures options reflect the minimum value these
options must hold to prevent arbitrage:

- **Call Option Lower Bound:**
  $$c \geq (F_0 - K)e^{-rT}$$

- **Put Option Lower Bound:**
  $$p \geq (K - F_0)e^{-rT}$$

### Black's Model for Valuing Futures Options

In the pricing of futures contracts, a pivotal assumption is that no initial investment
is required, leading to a **zero expected return in a risk-neutral environment**. This
implies that the expected growth rate of the futures price is also zero, essentially
treating the futures price as equivalent to a stock paying a continuous dividend yield
equal to the risk-free rate $r$. This approach simplifies the valuation by aligning the
futures price dynamics with those of a dividend-paying stock.

Black's model extends the classic Black-Scholes framework to futures options,
incorporating unique aspects of futures pricing:

- **Model Parameters:**
  - $S_0$, the current futures price, is denoted by $F_0$.
  - $q$, typically representing the dividend yield in stock options, is set to the
  domestic risk-free rate $r$ in the context of futures. This setting neutralizes the
  expected growth of the futures price, maintaining the risk-neutral valuation
  framework.

- **Historical Context:**
  - The model was first proposed by Fischer Black in 1976 and is specifically adapted
  for European options on futures, providing a practical solution that sidesteps the
  complexities of estimating income on the underlying asset.

### Pricing Formulas

The formulas for valuing European futures options using Black's model are derived as
follows:

- **Call Option Price:**
  $$ c = e^{-rT}[F_0 N(d_1) - K N(d_2) ] $$
- **Put Option Price:**
  $$ p = e^{-rT} [K N(-d_2) - F_0 N(-d_1)] $$

Where:
  $$ d_1 = \frac{\ln (F_0 / K) + \sigma^2 T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} $$
  $$ d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T} $$

### Futures Option Price vs. Spot Option Price

Comparing futures options to spot options under different market conditions reveals
nuanced valuation dynamics:

- **Normal Market Conditions (Contango):**
  - If futures prices are higher than spot prices, an American call option on futures is
  typically more valuable than a similar call option on the spot market. Conversely, an
  American put option on futures is less valuable than its spot counterpart.

- **Inverted Market Conditions (Backwardation):**
  - In situations where futures prices are lower than spot prices, the value
  relationships reverse: American calls on futures become less valuable, whereas puts on
  futures gain in relative value.
