## Yield Enhancement Investment Products

:::{.callout-note}
# Definition

Yield enhancement products are financial constructs with capped upside potential and
without capital guarantee, aiming to generate high returns relative to bond yields. The
risk level may approach that of the underlying assets in unfavorable market scenarios.
:::

- **Category Significance:** This is the largest category of structured products in
terms of both the variety of structures available and the volume of investments.
- **Capped Upside:** Historically, all yield enhancement products feature a capped
upside, contrasting with participation products that offer unlimited upside potential.
- **Popular Types:** The most prevalent forms are reverse convertibles and discount
certificates, which share similar payout profiles but differ in construction.

### Reverse Convertibles

- **Components:**
  1. **Zero-Coupon Bond:** Purchased to cover the product's lifetime, providing the base
  return.
  2. **Short Plain Vanilla Put Option:** Sold on the underlying risky asset to generate
  additional premium.

![](images/02-reverse-convertible.svg)

:::{.callout-note}
# Example

The zero-coupon bond yields 4%, and the short put option provides a premium of 8%. The
combined coupon is 12%, allowing the underlying asset to decline by up to 12% before the
investor experiences a loss.
:::

- **Risk Considerations:** The maximum potential loss is limited to the coupon received.
However, the risk of loss increases if the underlying asset's price falls significantly
beyond the cushion provided by the coupon.

### Worst-of Barrier Reverse Convertible

- **Enhanced Features:**
  1. **Multiple Underlyings:** The payoff depends on the performance of the
  worst-performing asset.
  2. **Knock-in Barrier:** Added to the short put option to provide conditional capital
  protection unless the barrier is breached.

![](images/02-barrier-reverse-convertible-construction.svg)

- **Behavioral Dynamics:** The presence of a barrier can lead to a sharp price
adjustment if the underlying reaches this level, activating the put option.

### Discount Certificates

- **Structure:**
  1. **Long Zero-Strike Call Option:** Replicates the performance of the underlying
  asset.
  2. **Short Call Option:** Set at- or out-of-the-money to provide upfront income by
  reducing the purchase price.

![](images/02-discount-certificate-construction.svg)

- **Economic Rationale:** The premium from the short call lowers the effective purchase
price of the zero-strike call, providing an immediate financial benefit, which contrasts
with the deferred coupon payment structure of reverse convertibles.

- **Tax Efficiency:** In some jurisdictions, the structure of discount certificates can
offer tax advantages over other investment products.

### Strategic Variations and Recommendations

- **Barrier-Linked Coupons:** Linking the coupon payment to the breaching of one or more
barriers can significantly increase the potential return but also adds to the risk.
- **Individualized Barriers:** In worst-of barrier products, setting specific barrier
levels for each underlying can tailor the risk to more accurately reflect the volatility
and performance expectations of each asset.
- **Barrier Perception:** Investors should not underestimate the risk associated with
barriers, as these are high-risk products without capital guarantees.
- **Product Complexity:** Avoid investing in products based on too many underlying
assets to manage risk more effectively. Preferably, limit the number of underlyings to
two.
- **Barrier Style:** Opt for European-style barriers when market volatility is high and
the medium-term market trajectory is uncertain, as these barriers typically offer a
lower coupon but reduce the risk of early activation.

## Behavior of Yield Enhancement Products

### Knock-In Reverse Convertibles - Case Study

Knock-in reverse convertibles are complex financial instruments designed to enhance
yields by incorporating a conditional protection feature, which activates under specific
market conditions. Here's a detailed analysis of the behavior of such products, using a
specific example for illustration.

|   **Characteristic**              | **Details**            |
|:---------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| **Underlying Risky Asset**        | Eurostoxx50 Index      |
| **Maturity**                      | 1 year                 |
| **Implied Volatility**            | 23%                    |
| **Asset's Dividend Yield (p.a.)** | 4.0%                   |
| **Interest Rate (4-year swap rate, p.a.)** | 4.5%        |
| **Barrier Level (% of spot)**     | 75%                    |
| **Coupon**                        | 10.4%                  |

| **Factor (Increase)** | **Impact on Product's Price** | **Impact Level** |
|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:----------------:|
| Spot Price            | Positive                      | Maximum          |
| Implied Volatility    | Negative                      | High             |
| Implied Correlation   | Positive                      | Medium-Low       |
| Interest Rates        | Negative                      | Low              |
| Dividends             | Negative                      | Low              |

### Variations in Spot Price

- **At Issue Date:** The product exhibits bond-like characteristics when the spot price
of the underlying asset increases, yet behaves akin to the asset itself with a decline
in price, increasing the delta.
- **Near Maturity:** A significant gap develops; the delta can exceed 1, indicating
increased sensitivity to spot price movements.
- **Delta Analysis:** The delta of approximately 34% suggests a 34% probability that the
underlying's price decline will activate the knock-in feature (e.g., a 25% or greater
drop in the Eurostoxx50).
- **Investor Perception:** While less risky than direct exposure to the underlying
asset, the delta range (30%-40%) illustrates that these products are considerably more
volatile than bonds.

### Impact of Implied Volatility Changes

- **Price Sensitivity:** Implied volatility significantly affects the product's price,
particularly near the barrier. A lower volatility reduces price sensitivity to spot
variations except near this critical threshold.
- **Investment Timing:** Higher initial implied volatility is advantageous as it allows
for purchasing more protective options at a lower cost. Conversely, a drop in volatility
after issuance benefits the mark-to-market valuation.
- **Product Lifespan:** Don't default to one-year products; sometimes shorter or longer
maturities may align better with market conditions or portfolio strategies.

### Understanding Implied Correlation

:::{.callout-tip}
# Definition
Implied correlation reflects the expected linear relationship between two or more
assets, as inferred from market prices.
:::

- **Significance in Multi-Asset Products:** Essential for assessing the risk and
potential return in products with multiple underlyings, such as 'worst-of' options,
where a higher correlation can lead to enhanced coupon rates.

- **Asset Addition Risks:** Introducing additional underlyings for a modest increase in
coupon (1%-2%) is generally not justified by the associated increase in risk,
particularly for volatile stocks.

- **Risk Assessment:** Carefully evaluate the added value versus risk when including
multiple assets. The incremental risk often outweighs the potential return enhancement,
especially when the volatility of additional assets is high.

## Leverage Products

Leverage products are financial instruments that provide a cost-effective way to gain
exposure to various assets (shares, indices, commodities, currencies) with a smaller
investment than purchasing the assets directly. These products amplify potential returns
and increase the risk of loss, making them suitable for speculative purposes or for
hedging against market movements.

### Warrants

:::{.callout-tip}
# Definition

Warrants are financial instruments granting the holder the right, but not the
obligation, to buy (Call Warrants) or sell (Put Warrants) an underlying asset at a
predetermined price (strike price) on or before a specific date.
:::

- **Characteristics:**
  - Warrants are similar to options but usually have longer maturities and cover a
  broader range of underlying assets.
  - Issued by financial institutions, warrants are bespoke products with terms set by
  the issuer.
  - Investors face the credit risk of the issuer since warrants are not backed by the
  assets themselves.
  - Warrants are highly liquid and can be used to leverage positions, hedge risks, or
  exploit arbitrage opportunities.

![](images/08-warrant.svg)

#### Types of Warrants

- **Traditional Warrants:** Issued by companies, often alongside bonds ("warrant-linked
bonds") to raise capital at a lower interest cost. These warrants can be detached and
sold separately.
- **Covered Warrants:** Issued by financial institutions and backed by assets the
institution holds or can acquire. They can cover a wide range of assets beyond equities.
- **Naked Warrants:** Issued without backing assets; issuers hedge their exposure
through other means.

#### Spread Warrants

- **Purpose:** Designed to benefit from rising (bull warrants) or falling (bear
warrants) markets.
- **Risks and Rewards:** While the initial investment is small and can yield significant
leveraged gains, the maximum loss and gain are capped, and the value deteriorates as
expiration approaches.

![](images/08-spread-warrant.svg)

#### Knock-Out Warrants

- **Feature:** These products have an embedded barrier that, if reached, causes the
warrant to expire worthless immediately.
- **Market Suitability:** Ideal for scenarios with clear directional market expectations
and a significant buffer between the current price and the knock-out level.
- **Risk Profile:** Higher leverage compared to traditional warrants, with little to no
time value, making them highly sensitive to market movements.

![](images/08-knock-out-warrant.svg)

#### Double Knock-Out Warrants

- **Design:** These warrants have two barriers (upper and lower), offering a balanced
approach to leveraging both upward and downward market movements.

![](images/08-double-knock-out-warrant.svg)

### Mini-Futures

- **Comparison with Warrants:** Similar to knock-out products but open-ended, with no
fixed expiration date unless the knock-out threshold is breached.
- **Investment Strategy:** Suitable for short-term speculative bets or hedging, with
potential for residual value redemption after a stop-loss event.

![](images/08-mini-futures.svg)

### Constant Leverage Certificates

- **Function:** These certificates provide fixed daily leverage on the price movements
of an underlying asset, without any knock-out barriers.
- **Benefits:** They offer continuous exposure to price movements, unaffected by the
underlying's volatility, and are not limited by time decay.

## Common Special Features of Structured Products

Structured products often incorporate complex features to enhance their appeal to investors. These features, such as autocalls, callable options, and choices between physical or cash settlements, add flexibility and potentially higher returns under certain conditions, but also introduce specific risks and complexities.

### Autocall and Callable Options

:::{.callout-tip}
# Definition

An autocall is a feature where the issuer is obligated to redeem the product when a
predefined event occurs, which can be set to trigger at any time or on a specific date,
at a predetermined price.
:::

- **Callable Options:** Allow the issuer to decide whether to redeem the product on
predetermined dates, providing more control over the product's lifecycle.

#### Autocallable Notes

- **Structure:** Typically includes full capital protection with the issuer redeeming
the product if the underlying asset closes above a certain threshold (e.g., 100%) at
predefined observation dates.
- **Returns:** Investors receive their capital plus a coupon, which is a percentage
multiplied by the number of years the product has run.

![](images/04-autocallable-note.svg)

#### Express Certificate

- **Features:** Combines an autocallable structure with conditional capital protection,
usually involving a down-and-in barrier option.
- **Volatility Sensitivity:** High sensitivity to volatility due to the barrier;
investors are effectively short volatility, losing out when it rises.

![](images/04-express-certificate.svg)

#### Autocallable Worst-Of Barrier Reverse Convertibles

- **Mechanism:** Functions like standard barrier reverse convertibles but includes an
autocall feature that triggers early redemption if all underlying assets exceed a
certain level (e.g., 105% of initial spot).
- **Correlation Impact:** The correlation between the underlyings is crucial, as it
affects the likelihood of all assets meeting the trigger condition simultaneously.

### Settlement Types in Equity-Based Products

Structured products based on equities, such as reverse convertibles or bonus
certificates, can offer different types of settlements:

1. **Physical Delivery:** Investors receive the actual shares at the redemption date,
which might occur weeks after the expiry date of the embedded options.
2. **Cash Settlement:** Provides investors with a cash amount equivalent to the value of
the shares at expiry.

- **Investor Considerations:** Cash settlements are often preferred as they provide
immediate liquidity and avoid the market risk associated with holding the actual shares
until the redemption date.
- **Market Preferences:** Retail products are typically settled physically, appealing to
investors' behavioral tendencies to hold onto stocks rather than realizing losses.

### Issue Minimum/Maximum Size and Liquidity Considerations

#### Minimum Size

- **Cost Implications:** The issuer will only launch a product if it can cover fixed and
variable costs such as listing fees, back-office operations, and computational expenses.
- **Investor Strategy:** Prefer products from issuers with lower operational costs, as
these savings can be passed on in the product's pricing.

#### Maximum Size

- **Risk Management:** Issuers limit the size of a product based on their capacity to
hedge the associated risks effectively, particularly for less liquid underlyings.
- **Market Influence:** Large hedging operations can inadvertently affect the market
price of the underlying, potentially impacting the performance of the product.

![Reverse convertible as a function of spot price and time to maturity](images/03-reverse-convertible-1.svg)

![Reverse convertible hedging example](images/05-hedging-example.svg)

#### Liquidity

- **Trading Spreads:** Vary significantly by region and issuer; narrower spreads in
markets like Germany enhance trading viability for smaller sizes.
- **Secondary Market:** Liquidity is typically provided by the issuer, making it
essential for investors to consider the availability of market quotes, especially if
they plan to trade the product before maturity.
