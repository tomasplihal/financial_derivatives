# Introduction to Hedging with Futures

## Strategy

- Manages price volatility risk
- **Long Futures Hedge:** Locks in purchase price
- **Short Futures Hedge:** Secures selling price

## Arguments For/Against Hedging

- Hedge or not to hedge?

## Basis Risk

- Risk from price difference (basis) between spot and futures
- Causes
- Mitigation Strategies

## Cross Hedging

- Utilizes futures of correlated but different assets

## Optimal Hedge Ratio

- $$h^{*} = \rho \frac{\sigma_S}{\sigma_F}$$

- $$N^{*} = h^{*} \times \frac{Q_A}{Q_F}$$

## Daily Settlement Adjustment

- $$\hat{h} = \hat{\rho} \frac{\hat{\sigma_S}}{\hat{\sigma_F}}$$

- $$N^{*} = \hat{h} \times \frac{V_A}{V_F}$$

# Stock Index Futures

## Hedging Portfolio

$$\beta \times \frac{V_A}{V_F}$$

## Adjusting Portfolio Beta

$$(\beta^{*} - \beta) \times \frac{V_A}{V_F}$$

## Hedging Benefits

- Market timing without selling
- Precise risk management
- Performance based on asset selection

## Stack and Roll Strategy

- Continuous hedging by rolling contracts
- Potential for realized losses vs. unrealized gains
